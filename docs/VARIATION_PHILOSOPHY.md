# Melodic Recomposition in Irish Traditional Music
## Non-Ornamental Variation Techniques

---

## Executive Summary

**Melodic recomposition** refers to the systematic process of creating variations of a melody while preserving its essential identity and structural integrity. This document focuses on **non-ornamental variation techniques** - changes to the actual melodic content, harmonic structure, and rhythmic framework, rather than decorative embellishments.

This guide helps distinguish between:
- **Traditional variation** (within Irish trad idiom)
- **Contemporary/Jazz-influenced variation** (modal, quartal, bebop)
- **Avant-garde variation** (experimental, boundary-pushing)

## 1. Traditional Variation (Session-Standard)

### What It Sounds Like
- Recognizable as "the tune" to any session musician
- Fits within established Irish trad aesthetic
- Could have been played 100 years ago

### Techniques

#### A. Melodic Substitution
- **Neighbor tones**: Replace a note with its upper/lower neighbor
- **Diatonic substitution**: Swap notes within the mode
- **Octave displacement**: Move a phrase up/down an octave

#### B. Rhythmic Variation
- **Note grouping**: Change how notes are grouped within the beat
- **Emphasis shift**: Accent different beats
- **Dotting/Straightening**: Convert dotted rhythms to even (or vice versa)

#### C. Phrase Variation
- **Ending variation**: Different cadential patterns
- **Pick-up variation**: Alter the anacrusis
- **Internal substitution**: Change a few notes mid-phrase while keeping shape

#### D. Modal Characteristics
- Stay **strictly within the mode** (no chromatic notes)
- Preserve the **essential intervals** that define the tune
- Maintain **phrase structure** (AABB, AABA, etc.)

### Examples
- Different settings of "The Kesh Jig" on The Session
- Regional variations of "The Bucks of Oranmore"

---

## 2. Extended Traditional

### What It Sounds Like
- Still recognizably Irish, but pushing boundaries
- Modern session players might use these techniques
- Inspired by players like Dónal Lunny, Paddy Keenan

### Techniques

#### A. Harmonic Recontextualization
- **Diatonic thirds/fifths**: Add harmonic intervals while staying in mode
- **Drone notes**: Sustain a pedal tone underneath
- **Open voicings**: Use wider intervals

#### B. Cross-Rhythm
- **3 against 2**: Polyrhythmic patterns within jig/reel structure
- **Metric displacement**: Shift accents to create tension

#### C. Dynamic Shaping
- **Crescendo/diminuendo**: Dynamic build within a phrase
- **Textural contrast**: Sparse vs dense passages

### Examples
- Planxty's arrangements
- Early Bothy Band harmonic approaches

---

## 3. Contemporary/Jazz Fusion

### What It Sounds Like
- Modal jazz meets Irish trad
- Uses chromatic notes, quartal harmony, bebop techniques
- Inspired by: Martin Hayes & Dennis Cahill, Notify, John McSherry

### Techniques

#### A. Quartal Harmony
- **Fourth-based chords**: [EA], [AD], [DG]
- **Sparse quartal**: Harmony on beats 1 & 5 only
- **Moving quartal**: Parallel fourths following melody

#### B. Chromatic Embellishment
- **Passing tones**: Chromatic notes between scale degrees
- **Approach notes**: Bebop-style chromatic approaches to target notes
- **Blues notes**: Flatted thirds/sevenths (used sparingly)

#### C. Modal Interchange
- **Borrow from parallel modes**: Mix Dorian with Aeolian
- **Secondary dominants**: Brief tonicizations
- **Suspended harmonies**: Add tension/release

#### D. Rhythmic Complexity
- **5/4 sections**: Shift between 6/8 and 5/4
- **Metric modulation**: Change the pulse
- **Syncopation**: Off-beat accents

### Examples
- Notify's "Retune"
- The Gloaming's arrangements
- Martin Hayes solo playing

---

## 4. Avant-Garde/Experimental

### What It Sounds Like
- The tune becomes a **starting point** for exploration
- May be unrecognizable to session musicians
- Inspired by: Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh, Iarla Ó Lionáird, Córas

### Techniques

#### A. Deconstruction
- **Extreme tempo shifts**: Play at 1/4 or 4x speed
- **Fragmentation**: Isolate 2-3 notes and loop
- **Silence**: Long pauses between phrases

#### B. Timbral Transformation
- **Extended techniques**: Bowing behind the bridge, microtones
- **Electronics**: Looping, delay, reverb as compositional tools
- **Noise elements**: Incorporate breath, string noise

#### C. Harmonic Extremes
- **Cluster chords**: Dissonant note clusters
- **Bitonality**: Two keys simultaneously
- **Microtonal shifts**: Quarter-tone bends

#### D. Temporal Stretching
- **Drone minimalism**: Stretch melody over evolving drone (60+ seconds)
- **Free time**: Abandon strict meter
- **Gradual acceleration/deceleration**

### Examples
- Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh's solo work
- The Gloaming's "The Sailor's Bonnet"
- Slow-air treatments of dance tunes

## Preservation Principles

When varying a tune, always preserve:

1. **Melodic contour**: The overall shape (rising, falling, arch)
2. **Cadential points**: Where phrases resolve
3. **Phrase structure**: AABB, AABA, etc.
4. **Mode**: Stay in the original mode (unless explicitly modulating)
5. **Character**: The tune's "feel" (playful, melancholy, driving)

## User Control: Variation Intensity Slider

When building a variation tool, offer users control:

```
[Traditional] ――――――――|―――――――― [Avant-Garde]
                     ↑
                User sets here
```

**Level 1 (Traditional)**: Neighbor tones, diatonic substitution only
**Level 2 (Extended)**: Add diatonic thirds, drone, octave shifts
**Level 3 (Contemporary)**: Quartal harmony, chromatic passing tones
**Level 4 (Fusion)**: Modal interchange, metric modulation
**Level 5 (Avant-Garde)**: Anything goes - clusters, microtones, deconstruction

---

## Recommendation System

When analyzing a tune from The Session:

1. **If tune has 20+ settings**: Likely traditional-friendly → suggest Level 1-2
2. **If tune is rare/experimental**: More freedom → suggest Level 3-4
3. **If in minor mode**: Chromatic approaches often work well → suggest Level 3
4. **If in major mode**: Stay traditional → suggest Level 1-2

---

## Testing Variation Appropriateness

Ask these questions:

1. **Would this fit in a session?** → Traditional
2. **Would this work in a concert setting?** → Extended/Contemporary
3. **Would this work as a solo exploration?** → Avant-Garde
4. **Can people still recognize the tune?** → If no, too extreme

---

## Examples by Tune Type

### Jigs (6/8)
- **Traditional**: The Kesh, Sliabh Russell - stay close to source
- **Contemporary**: Add quartal harmony, rhythmic displacement
- **Avant-Garde**: Stretch to slow-air, drone minimalism

### Reels (4/4)
- **Traditional**: Miss McLeod's - melodic substitution only
- **Contemporary**: Chromatic passing tones, jazz harmony
- **Avant-Garde**: Metric modulation to 5/4, deconstruction

### Slow Airs
- **Traditional**: Preserve ornamentation style
- **Contemporary**: Harmonic reharmonization
- **Avant-Garde**: Electronics, extreme dynamics

## Notes for Developers

- **Default to Traditional** unless user explicitly requests contemporary/avant-garde
- **Label variations clearly**: "This is a contemporary jazz-influenced variation"
- **Offer examples**: Show what each level sounds like before generating
- **Allow filtering**: Let users exclude techniques they don't want

## Philosophical Note

**There is no "correct" version of a tune.** Irish traditional music thrives on variation - every player has their own version. The question isn't "is this variation valid?" but rather "what aesthetic framework does this variation operate within?"

This guide helps you navigate those frameworks consciously.
