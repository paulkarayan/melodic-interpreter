# Programming Irish Traditional Music Harmony for Anglo Concertina and Diatonic Button Accordion

Irish traditional music harmony follows modal principles fundamentally different from classical Western harmony. Harmony was only introduced in the 1960s-70s; the tradition was originally monophonic. When harmonizing, the melody always dominates, and accompaniment must be sparse, supportive, and modally aware.

## 1. Common Chord Progressions: Mode-Specific Rules

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** There are no universal chord progressions in Irish music. Each tune has unique harmonic architecture. Standard pop progressions (I-V-vi-IV) will fail catastrophically.

### Mixolydian Mode (Most Common in Irish Music)

**Signature characteristic:** Flatted 7th degree (bVII chord)

- **Primary progression:** I → bVII → I
- **Extended progression:** I → bVII → IV → I (the "Mixolydian vamp")
- **Example in D Mixolydian:** D → C → D or D → C → G → D
- **Example in G Mixolydian:** G → F → G
- **Available chords:** I (major), bVII (major), IV (major), ii (minor), v (minor)
- **FORBIDDEN:** V7 chord (this imposes Ionian tonality and destroys the modal character)
- **Rule:** Never use leading tone resolution (don't use D7 → G in G Mixolydian; use F → G instead)

### Dorian Mode (Optimistic Minor)

**Signature characteristic:** Natural 6th degree with minor 3rd (major IV chord)

- **Primary progression:** i → IV → i
- **Alternative:** i → bVII → i
- **Example in E Dorian:** Em → A → Em or Em → D → Em
- **Example in A Dorian:** Am → D → Am or Am → G → Am
- **Available chords:** i (minor), IV (major), bVII (major), v (minor), bIII (major)
- **Critical distinction:** Uses major IV, NOT minor iv (minor iv would make it Aeolian)
- **Rule:** The major IV chord is the defining feature - always use D major for E Dorian, not D minor

### Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)

**Signature characteristic:** Flatted 6th degree (darker than Dorian)

- **Primary progression:** i → bVII → bVI → bVII (Aeolian shuttle)
- **Alternative:** i → bVII → i
- **Example in E Aeolian:** Em → D → C → D or Em → D → Em
- **Available chords:** i (minor), bVII (major), bVI (major), iv (minor), bIII (major)
- **Rule:** Uses both bVI and bVII; minor iv distinguishes from Dorian

### Ionian Mode (Major)

**Least common in traditional Irish music**

- **Standard progression:** I → IV → V → I
- **Alternative:** I → vi → IV → V
- **Example in G Major:** G → C → D → G or G → Em → C → D
- **Available chords:** I, IV, V (major), ii, iii, vi (minor)
- **Rule:** Standard major key harmony applies, but still keep it simple

### Universal Modal Rules

**Power Chords (Root + Fifth Only):**
- **When to use:** Dorian, Mixolydian, or Aeolian modes where tonality is ambiguous
- **Why:** Omitting the 3rd preserves modal ambiguity and lets melody define the character
- **Structure:** Root + 5th + bass octave (e.g., D-A-D)
- **Benefit:** Creates drone effect suitable for Celtic tradition

**Forbidden Chords:**
- **Never use:** Diminished chords (viio) - they sound unstable and clash with modal features
- **Avoid:** Augmented chords (not part of tradition)
- **Avoid:** Extended jazz chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) unless in contemporary arrangements

## 2. Anglo Concertina Harmony Approach

### Physical Button Combinations (C/G 30-button standard)

**G Major Chord (Press):**
- Basic triad: G + B + D (buttons G3, C4, G4)
- With bass: Left pinky flattened across G2 and C2 (plays G and D), plus G at G3
- **Rule:** Hold for maximum 1-2 beats before bellows change

**D Major Chord (Draw - preferred):**
- D5 power chord: D at C3 + A at G1 (bass) or G3 (higher)
- Full triad (draw): D + F# + A
- **Note:** F# + D at G3 with low A makes very useful combination

**C Major Chord (Press):**
- Triad: C + E + G at buttons C3, C4, C5
- Can omit E for C5 chord
- Add low C at C1 for bass

**A Minor Chord (Draw):**
- Most common: A at G1 + A at G3 + C at G4 + E at G5
- Very powerful with bass A and E
- A5 (draw): Omit C, works for both major and minor contexts

**E Minor Chord (Press):**
- Simple triad: E + G + B
- With bass: Add low E at T1
- E5 (press): Just E and B sufficient

**Fundamental Constraint:** As soon as there's a bellows change, the chord is lost. Brief chordal pulses enrich the sound; sustained chords are impossible.

### Self-Harmonization Intervals for Anglo Concertina

**Priority Hierarchy:**

1. **Parallel thirds (FIRST CHOICE):** Play melody + adjacent button down simultaneously
   - Works most of the time in major keys
   - Must be discriminating - some melody notes stay solo or drop out
   - Creates instant harmony on same row

2. **Fifth intervals (POWER CHORDS):** Root + 5th
   - Only ties up 2-3 fingers
   - Gives droney effect suitable for folk music
   - Doesn't overpower melody

3. **Octaves:** Unison playing octave apart between hands
   - Creates quite full sound, more powerful than expected
   - Requires practice (counter-intuitive fingering)
   - Traditional style (William Kimber, Scan Tester)

4. **Sixths:** Melody sixth lower (more on left hand)
   - Works best on tunes that don't jump around
   - Less common than thirds

5. **Single bass notes (drones):** Add extra timbre and depth
   - Often just root note held with melody
   - Safe choice when uncertain

### Voice Leading for Anglo Concertina

**The Golden Rule: NEVER CHOP**
- Never move same finger from one button to another consecutively
- "Chopping is the one thing most accomplished players agree should never be part of technique"
- Slows you down and becomes awkward at faster speeds
- Use duplicate buttons to avoid: three middle A's available, two C#'s (Jeffries)

**Cross-Row Playing (Noel Hill Method):**
- Specifically designed to reduce bellows movement
- Follow "Z-pattern" across keyboard
- Example D scale: Start C row (LH D draw), then G row F# draw, back to C row
- Allows smoother, more flowing musical phrases
- First choice for fingering to maintain bellows direction longer

**Bellows Direction Strategy:**
1. Melody notes dictate primary bellows direction
2. Look for alternative fingerings to get desired chord direction
3. Balance draw-heavy passages with push passages
4. Can play "um and pa at once" (bass + chord simultaneously) to avoid awkward direction changes

**Vamping Pattern (Um-Pa):**
- Bass note on "um" (left pinky on beat)
- Chord on "pa" (other three fingers on offbeat)
- Direction determined by melody notes
- Low bass note followed by high chord sounds best for dance music

### What Doesn't Work on Anglo Concertina

**Physical Limitations:**
- Full triads generally unnecessary or too awkward
- Cannot sustain chords through bellows change
- Small bellows can exhaust air reserve with rhythmic play (must use air button frequently)
- Lower buttons (T1 position) require wrist swivel
- Legato difficult compared to English concertina - staccato more natural

**Harmonic Limitations:**
- F major: Limited options, must use draw (no F on press)
- G7: Only on draw
- A7: Leave out C# - too awkward, especially transitioning to D
- Some transitions impossible without mid-chord bellows change
- Key limitations: Playing in normal fiddle keys (G, D, A minor, E minor) requires picking notes from all over keyboard

**Critical Rule:** Don't bury tune in cacophony of chords. Melody must come over clearly. Chords should be brief and staccato to preserve melody clarity.

## 3. Diatonic Button Accordion Harmony Approach

### Bass Button System (Left Hand)

**Standard B/C Irish Box (8-bass layout):**
- Four pairs of buttons: (1) root note + (2) major triad chord
- Bisonoric: Bass notes AND chords change with bellows direction
- Common retuning: F/F bass button retuned to D for Irish music

**B/C Standard Layout (Push/Pull):**
- Row 1: G/D (bass), C/G (chord)
- Row 2: C/G (bass), retuned to D/D (chord)
- Row 3: E/A (bass), corresponding chords
- Row 4: Retuned D bass for flexibility

**Critical Finding:** Many Irish box players don't play the basses at all and project rhythm through ornamentation (cuts, rolls, triplets). This is entirely traditional and acceptable.

### Bass Playing Patterns (When Used)

**Michael Eskin Method (Documented Traditional Style):**

**For Reels/Hornpipes (4/4 time):**
- Bass buttons: ONLY on chord changes (not every downbeat)
- Chord buttons: ONLY on offbeats
- Result: Sparse, punctuated accompaniment
- Pattern: `D_bass _ D_chord _ | (hold through non-chord-change bars)`

**For Jigs (6/8 time):**
- Bass buttons: Only on chord changes
- Chord buttons: On beats 3 and 6
- Never on every downbeat

**For Slides (12/8 time):**
- Bass buttons: Only on chord changes
- Chord buttons: On beats 3, 6, 9, and 12

**For Waltzes (3/4 time):**
- Traditional bass-chord-chord pattern
- Beat 1: Bass note
- Beat 2: Chord
- Beat 3: Chord

**Alternative Pattern (More Driving, Less Traditional):**
- Bass on every downbeat PLUS chord changes
- More common in céilí bands
- Can overpower in session settings

### Right-Hand Harmony (Bellows Chords)

**Rare in Traditional Irish Box Playing**

When present:
- Push bellows: All buttons produce notes from major triad of home key
- Can play major chord inversions by pressing multiple adjacent buttons simultaneously
- Notation: [5 6 7] = simultaneous button press
- **Limitation:** Harmony is diatonic and bellows-direction-dependent
- Cannot easily create minor, diminished, or seventh chords without crossing rows

### Self-Harmonization on Diatonic Accordion

**Intervals When Used:**

1. **Diatonic thirds:** Melody + note two scale degrees above/below
   - B/C layout facilitates through row-crossing
   - Warning: Must respect modal harmony

2. **Octaves:** Doubling melody line
   - Relatively safe harmonically
   - Achievable across rows

3. **Sixths:** Less common but occasionally used
   - Creates fuller sound without clashing

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Dense harmony (clashes with modal nature)
- Constant parallel motion (sounds static due to bisonoric limitations)
- Complex jazz voicings
- Fourths and fifths in sustained parallel motion

**Traditional Approach:** NO self-harmonization - melody only with ornamentation providing rhythmic drive.

### Two-Row vs. Three-Row Differences

**Two-Row B/C System:**
- 8 bass buttons (limited chord vocabulary for I-IV-V)
- Bass notes sometimes in wrong direction for certain keys
- Challenge: A major has most notes on PULL (awkward bass coordination)
- "The difficulties inherent in playing with all notes but not every note in both directions are part of what makes the B/C style distinctive"

**Three-Row B/C/C# System:**
- Typically features full Stradella bass (120 buttons) - unisonoric left hand
- All bass notes available in both directions
- Full chord vocabulary (major, minor, seventh, diminished)
- More harmonic flexibility but less common in Irish tradition
- Heavier instrument, changes characteristic sound

### Bass Runs and Movement

**Ascending Diatonic:**
- Example in D: D - E - F# - G - A
- At cadence points, coordinated with melody phrasing

**Descending Chromatic:**
- Creates tension/interest
- Example: D - C# - C - B - A
- Used sparingly

**Simple Bass Rule:** "When you play a tune in D or G you simply play the same (or harmonizing) bass as the treble on the first beat of the bar."
- If melody note is A, play A bass
- If melody note is F#, play D bass (harmonizing)

### What Doesn't Work on Diatonic Accordion

**Cannot Do:**
1. Complex chord progressions (limited 8-bass vocabulary)
2. Voice leading with inversions (fixed chord voicings)
3. Chromatic harmony (bass chords are diatonic only)
4. Sustained chords while changing melody bellows direction
5. Minor chord accompaniment on right hand without complex cross-rowing

**Keys That Don't Work Well:**
- D/G melodeon: Cannot play in A, E, C effectively
- B/C box in A major: Most notes on pull (very awkward)

**Many Players Tape Off Thirds:**
- Removes third from chord buttons
- Creates root-fifth chord only (more modal)
- Better for preserving modal character

## 4. Instrument-Specific Self-Harmonization Summary

### Anglo Concertina Self-Harmonization Rules

**Interval Preference Hierarchy:**
1. Parallel thirds (adjacent buttons, automatic on same row)
2. Fifth intervals (power chords, root + 5th)
3. Octaves (special emphasis, traditional style)
4. Sixths (occasional use on non-jumpy tunes)
5. Single drone notes (safest choice)

**Critical Constraints:**
- Maximum chord duration: 1-2 beats (bellows change limitation)
- Must avoid "chopping" (same finger consecutively)
- Cross-row playing reduces bellows changes
- Melody highest unless specific effect desired
- Chords brief and staccato to preserve melody clarity

**Prohibited Techniques:**
- No sustained full triads
- No parallel motion causing chopping
- No extended legato across bellows change
- No excessive awkward stretches (low T1 positions)

### Diatonic Accordion Self-Harmonization Rules

**Primary Approach: NO SELF-HARMONIZATION**
- Melody only with ornamentation (cuts, rolls, triplets) for rhythm
- This is traditional and correct
- Bass rarely used in sessions

**When Harmony IS Used (Performance Context):**
- Sparse chord punctuation, not continuous accompaniment
- Open voicings avoiding third (modal ambiguity)
- Root-fifth patterns preferred
- Bass runs: Chromatic descending or diatonic walking patterns

**Interval Guidelines:**
1. Diatonic thirds (when crossing rows carefully)
2. Octaves (safe, achievable across rows)
3. Sixths (occasional)
4. Avoid: Dense harmony, constant parallel motion, complex voicings

**Bellows Direction Planning:**
- Melody direction takes priority
- Find alternate fingerings or accept sparse accompaniment
- Key-dependent: D major easier than A major on B/C
- Conflicts force compromise between melody fingering and bass availability

## 5. Modal Considerations: Detailed Implementation

### Mode Detection Algorithm

```
IF melody_ends_on = tonic AND contains_flatted_7th = TRUE AND sounds_bright = TRUE:
    mode = "Mixolydian"

IF melody_ends_on = tonic AND contains_flatted_3rd = TRUE AND contains_natural_6th = TRUE:
    mode = "Dorian"

IF melody_ends_on = tonic AND contains_flatted_3rd = TRUE AND contains_flatted_6th = TRUE:
    mode = "Aeolian"

IF melody = major_scale AND no_modal_characteristics:
    mode = "Ionian"
```

### Chord Scale Tables for Programming

**G Ionian Group (1 sharp: F#):**
| Mode | Tonic | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | Notes |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| G Ionian | **G** | Am | Bm | **C** | **D** | Em | Standard major |
| A Dorian | **Am** | Bm | C | **D** | Em | F#dim | Optimistic minor |
| D Mixolydian | **D** | Em | F#dim | **G** | Am | Bm | Uses **C** (bVII) |
| E Aeolian | **Em** | F#dim | G | Am | Bm | **C** | Uses **D** (bVII) |

**D Ionian Group (2 sharps: F#, C#):**
| Mode | Tonic | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | Notes |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| D Ionian | **D** | Em | F#m | **G** | **A** | Bm | Standard major |
| E Dorian | **Em** | F#m | G | **A** | Bm | C#dim | Uses major **A** (IV) |
| A Mixolydian | **A** | Bm | C#dim | **D** | Em | F#m | Uses **G** (bVII) |
| B Aeolian | **Bm** | C#dim | D | Em | F#m | **G** | Dark minor |

**A Ionian Group (3 sharps: F#, C#, G#):**
| Mode | Tonic | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | Notes |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| A Ionian | **A** | Bm | C#m | **D** | **E** | F#m | Standard major |
| B Dorian | **Bm** | C#m | D | **E** | F#m | G#dim | Uses major **E** (IV) |
| E Mixolydian | **E** | F#m | G#dim | **A** | Bm | C#m | Uses **D** (bVII) |
| F# Aeolian | **F#m** | G#dim | A | Bm | C#m | **D** | Rare in Irish music |

### Modal Harmony Rules by Mode

**MIXOLYDIAN RULES (Most Important):**
1. **ALWAYS use bVII, NEVER use V7**
2. Avoid raised 7th (leading tone) which would make it Ionian
3. Progression: I → bVII → IV → I (classic vamp)
4. The bVII chord doesn't "resolve" - it alternates with tonic
5. Example: D Mixolydian uses C major (bVII), NEVER use A major or A7

**DORIAN RULES:**
1. **Use major IV chord** - distinguishes from Aeolian
2. Natural 6th is the characteristic note
3. Progression: i → IV → i or i → bVII → i
4. Avoid minor iv (would make it Aeolian)
5. Example: E Dorian uses A major (IV), NOT A minor

**AEOLIAN RULES:**
1. Use both bVI and bVII chords
2. Minor iv chord (not major IV as in Dorian)
3. Darker, more melancholic than Dorian
4. Progression: i → bVII → bVI → bVII (Aeolian shuttle)
5. Less common than Dorian in Irish music

**IONIAN RULES:**
1. Standard I-IV-V major progressions
2. Can use all diatonic major/minor triads
3. Less common than modal tunes
4. Still keep it simple - avoid complex jazz harmony

### Critical Implementation Rule

**IF mode = Dorian OR Mixolydian OR Aeolian:**
```
use_power_chords = TRUE (omit 3rd)
reason = "Prevents imposing major/minor tonality on modal melodies"
structure = root + 5th only
benefit = "Lets melody define the mode"
```

**Power Chord Voicing:**
- Anglo concertina: Left hand bass button + right hand 5th
- Diatonic accordion: Bass button only (no chord button) OR tape thirds off chord buttons
- Creates authentic drone effect from Celtic tradition

## 6. Voice Leading and Chord Voicing Principles

### Chord Inversions for Smooth Voice Leading

**Common Tone Rule:**
```
IF chord_change_has_common_tone:
    THEN use_inversion_with_common_tone_in_bass
```

**Examples:**
- G → Em: Use Em/B (Em with B in bass) for smooth connection
- D → A: Use A/C# for stepwise bass motion D → C#
- G → D: Use D/F# for smoother voice leading

**However:** Anglo concertina and diatonic accordion have LIMITED inversion control:
- Chords determined by physical button layout and bellows direction
- Cannot freely voice-lead like piano or guitar
- Work within instrument constraints

### Bass Movement Principles

**Preferred Bass Motion (Guitar/Piano):**
1. **Stepwise motion** (most preferred)
   - Example: G → F# → E when moving from G to Em
   - Creates walking bass line

2. **Leaps to 5th** (common)
   - Example: D → A when changing chords

3. **Leaps to octave** (acceptable)
   - Reinforces harmonic foundation

4. **Larger leaps** (use sparingly)
   - Can sound disjointed

**Walking Bass Pattern:**
```
Bar 1: D bass - D chord | D bass - D chord
Bar 2: E bass - A chord | F# bass - A chord
Bar 3: G bass - G chord | A bass - A chord
Bar 4: B bass - D chord | A bass - D chord
```

**For Anglo Concertina:** Left pinky plays bass on "um" (beat), other fingers play chord on "pa" (offbeat)

**For Diatonic Accordion:** Bass button on chord changes only, chord button on offbeats (NOT every downbeat)

### Pedal Tones (Drones)

**When to Use:**
```
IF mode = Dorian OR Mixolydian:
    THEN drone_allowable = TRUE
    
IF tune_pass = 1 (first time through):
    THEN strategy = "drone_on_tonic_only"
    reason = "Gives time to learn tune structure"
```

**Drone Strategy:**
- Hold tonic note continuously (or alternating tonic-fifth)
- Celtic tradition embraces drone (uilleann pipes, fiddle double stops)
- Safe choice when uncertain of harmony
- Anglo: Single bass button held
- Accordion: Single bass button (no chord buttons)

### Avoiding Parallel Motion

- **Avoid:** Parallel 5ths between chords (classical voice-leading rule still applies)
- **Use:** Contrary motion between bass and melody when possible
- **Prefer:** If melody ascending, bass descending

### Instrument-Specific Voicing

**Anglo Concertina:**
- Keep melody highest (right hand treble)
- Bass lowest (left hand)
- Chords middle register
- Staccato articulation preserves melody clarity
- Maximum sustain: 1-2 beats before bellows change forces stop

**Diatonic Accordion:**
- Melody on right hand only
- Bass and chords on left hand only
- Cannot control chord inversions (fixed by button system)
- Sparse texture essential - bass on chord changes only, chords on offbeats

**General Principle:** "Keep tune recognizable" - never bury melody in harmony

## 7. Rhythm and Timing: Chord Changes by Tune Type

### Jigs (6/8 Time)

**Strumming Pattern:** DOWN-up-down DOWN-up-down (mandatory for proper feel)

**Timing Rules:**
- Count: "1-2-3 4-5-6" or "diddly-diddly" or "JIG-i-ty JIG-i-ty"
- Chord changes at phrase boundaries: **every 2 bars minimum**
- Many jigs stay on one chord for **4+ bars**
- Structure: AABB format, 8 bars per part
- Emphasis on beats 1 and 4

**Chord Change Frequency:**
```
minimum_chord_duration = 2_bars
typical_chord_duration = 4_bars
maximum_before_boring = 8_bars
```

**Accompaniment Density:** Can be very sparse - droning on tonic chord is acceptable and traditional

**Diatonic Accordion Bass Pattern:**
- Bass buttons: Only on chord changes
- Chord buttons: On beats 3 and 6

### Reels (4/4 Time, Felt as 2/2 Cut Time)

**Strumming Pattern:** Steady driving rhythm, emphasis on beats 1 and 3

**Timing Rules:**
- Count: "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and" or "watermelon watermelon"
- Feel: Cut time (2/2), not regular 4/4
- Chord changes align with melodic phrases
- **ONE chord can last 4-8 bars in modal tunes**
- Structure: AABB format, 8 bars per part
- Tempo: 84-90 BPM for melody

**Chord Change Frequency:**
```
minimum_chord_duration = 2_bars
typical_chord_duration = 4_bars
modal_reels_can_stay_on_tonic = 8_bars
```

**Accompaniment:** Strong downbeat on 1 and 3, subtle accents for propulsion (not heavy on every beat)

**Diatonic Accordion Bass Pattern:**
- Bass buttons: Only on chord changes (not every downbeat)
- Chord buttons: Only on offbeats

### Hornpipes (4/4 Time with Swing)

**Strumming Pattern:** Swung/dotted rhythm - first note of pair longer than second

**Timing Rules:**
- Count: "ONE-and TWO-and THREE-and FOUR-and" with swing
- Feel: Dotted eighth + sixteenth note rhythm
- Mnemonic: "upsy daisy" or say "hornpipe" naturally
- Tempo: 104-110 BPM (slower than reels)
- Typical ending: Three quarter notes
- More rhythmic complexity than reels

**Differences from Reels:**
- More swung/bouncy feel
- Often contain arpeggios and large interval leaps
- Use bass runs between chords more extensively
- Common bowing pattern: 3-3-2 (slur-slur-separate)

**Chord Change Frequency:**
```
minimum_chord_duration = 2_bars
typical_chord_duration = 4_bars
use_more_bass_runs = TRUE
```

**Structure:** 8 bars per part, AABB format

### Slip Jigs (9/8 Time)

**Strumming Pattern:** Extended jig pattern to fit 9 beats

**Timing Rules:**
- Count: "1-2-3 4-5-6 7-8-9"
- Chord changes similar to jigs but with longer phrases
- More flowing feel than regular jigs
- Less common than regular jigs

### Polkas (2/4 Time)

**Timing Rules:**
- Fast 2/4 time
- **IF region = Sliabh Luachra:** Emphasize OFF-beats (one-AND two-AND)
- **ELSE:** Emphasize ON-beats (ONE-and TWO-and)
- Oom-pah feel on guitar/accordion
- Popular in County Kerry

### Slides (12/8 Time)

**Timing Rules:**
- Similar to jigs but in 12/8
- Lighter, more flowing than jigs
- Common in Kerry music

**Diatonic Accordion Bass Pattern:**
- Bass buttons: Only on chord changes
- Chord buttons: On beats 3, 6, 9, and 12

### Waltzes (3/4 Time)

**Timing Rules:**
- Traditional bass-chord-chord pattern
- Beat 1: Bass note
- Beat 2: Chord
- Beat 3: Chord
- Oom-pah-pah feel

### Universal Timing Principle

**CRITICAL RULE:** Chord changes do NOT occur mechanically every bar or every 2 bars. They occur at:
- Phrase boundaries (melodic phrases typically 2-4 bars)
- Melodic resolution points
- Key structural moments in tune architecture
- NOT at arbitrary bar lines

**Modal Tunes:** Reduce chord changes by 25% compared to major tunes. Can drone on tonic for extended periods.

## 8. Traditional vs. Contemporary Approaches

### Historical Context

**Pre-1960s - Original Tradition:**
- Irish traditional music was ENTIRELY MONOPHONIC
- No harmony or accompaniment existed
- Melody instruments (fiddle, flute, pipes, whistle) played in unison
- Uilleann pipes provided only drone harmony (tonic and dominant drones)
- "These people heard no harmony, there was no harmony. It didn't exist." - Martin Hayes

**1960s - Introduction of Harmony:**
- Guitar introduced through North American folk revival
- Johnny Moynihan introduced Greek bouzouki (late 1960s)
- Seán Ó Riada popularized bodhrán and formal ensembles
- DADGAD tuning introduced by Davy Graham (1962)

**1970s - Evolution:**
- Guitar became widespread for accompaniment
- Planxty, The Bothy Band, De Dannan established new standard
- Accompaniment gained sophistication but maintained supporting role

**Modern Era (1980s-Present):**
- Harmony fully integrated but remains supportive
- Increased sophistication while respecting tradition
- Contemporary players: Dennis Cahill, John Doyle, Carl Hession

### Traditional Approach Rules

**For Anglo Concertina and Diatonic Accordion:**

1. **Melody is KING** - Harmony always supports, never dominates
2. **Simple triads** - Root, third, fifth (or power chords omitting third)
3. **Modal/power chords** - Omit third for ambiguous major/minor sound
4. **Drone-based** - Single notes or open fifths
5. **Follow the tune** - Accompanist follows melody player, not vice versa
6. **Rhythmic function** - Provide rhythmic drive through articulation
7. **Limited chord vocabulary** - Stick to diatonic chords of the mode
8. **No extended harmony** - Avoid 7ths, 9ths, 13ths
9. **Sparse texture** - Leave space in the music
10. **Tune-specific** - No generic progressions
11. **Often NO harmony at all** - Melody only with ornamentation for rhythm

### Contemporary Approach (Within Tradition)

**Acceptable Modern Techniques:**

1. **Chromaticism** - Occasional semitone movement, passing chords (use sparingly)
2. **Bass runs** - Walking bass lines between chords
3. **Alternate chords** - Substitutions like vi for I, iii for I
4. **Extended chords** - Tasteful use of 7ths (especially maj7, sus4)
5. **Syncopation** - Off-beat accents
6. **Reharmonization** - Changing chords on repeats for variety
7. **Counter-melodies** - More melodic accompaniment
8. **Chord inversions** - Different voicings for color (where physically possible)
9. **Modal jazz influences** - Subtle, never dominant

**Still Forbidden:**
- Drowning out melody
- Jazz bebop harmony
- Heavy extended chords
- Constant reharmonization (first pass should be simple)
- Playing without knowing the tune

### Implementation Guidelines

**Traditional Style Programming:**
```
harmony_density = LOW (10-30% of phrases)
chord_vocabulary = [I, IV, V, vi] + modal adjustments
rhythm_source = ornamentation (cuts, rolls, triplets)
bass_usage = sparse (chord changes only)
extended_chords = FALSE
chromaticism = FALSE
```

**Contemporary Style Programming:**
```
harmony_density = MODERATE (30-60% of phrases)
chord_vocabulary = [I, IV, V, vi, ii, iii] + modal adjustments
rhythm_source = combination of ornamentation and accompaniment
bass_usage = moderate (downbeats + chord changes)
extended_chords = occasional (maj7, sus4 on long notes)
chromaticism = sparse (passing tones in bass runs)
```

**Both Styles:**
```
melody_dominance = ABSOLUTE
volume_level = SUBORDINATE to melody
tune_knowledge = REQUIRED before playing
modal_awareness = CRITICAL
```

## 9. What to Avoid: Comprehensive Prohibitions

### Strongly Forbidden

**1. Generic "Four-Chord" Progressions:**
```
NEVER use: I-V-vi-IV (pop progression)
NEVER use: I-vi-IV-V (50s progression)
NEVER use: ii-V-I (jazz progression)
reason = "Each tune requires individual harmonization"
error_message = "Generic patterns fail catastrophically, especially in B parts"
```

**2. Playing Without Knowing the Tune:**
- "No one wants to play with an accompanist who has learned just four chords and is going to play them regardless of which tune they're accompanying"
- Playing wrong chords is "extremely distracting to other musicians"
- **Rule:** If you don't know the tune, DON'T PLAY (or drone on tonic only)

**3. Playing Too Loud:**
- Drowning out melody players is major faux pas
- Volume should blend, not dominate
- "When in doubt, play more softly"
- **For AI:** Set accompaniment volume 30-40% below melody

**4. Dominant-Function V7 Chords (in Modal Tunes):**
```
IF mode = Mixolydian:
    THEN NEVER use V7 → I resolution
    reason = "Destroys modal character"
    correct = use bVII → I instead
    
example_wrong = "D7 → G in G Mixolydian"
example_correct = "F → G in G Mixolydian"
```

**5. Diminished Chords (viio):**
- Generally avoided as they "sound very unstable"
- "Clash with various features of the genre"
- Not part of modal harmony vocabulary
- Example: Avoid F#dim in G major tunes

**6. Wrong Modal Chords:**
```
IF mode = Dorian AND chord = minor_iv:
    ERROR = "Should be major IV"
    
IF mode = Mixolydian AND chord = major_V:
    ERROR = "Should be bVII"
    
IF mode = Dorian OR Mixolydian AND using raised_7th:
    ERROR = "Destroys modal character"
```

**7. Leading Tone Resolutions:**
- Avoid raised 7th (leading tone) in modal tunes
- Classical voice-leading rules don't apply
- Modal music doesn't use functional harmony

**8. Over-Complex Jazz Harmony:**
- Extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) generally inappropriate
- Complex substitutions from jazz
- "These really have very little to do with the Celtic tradition"
- Chromaticism should be minimal and tasteful

**9. Playing Without Listening:**
- Not following the melody player
- "Trying to control the rhythm and tempo"
- Forcing melody players to follow accompaniment
- **Rule:** "You are following them, but not dragging them back"

**10. Session Etiquette Violations:**
- Playing when you don't know the tune
- More than one accompaniment instrument at once (unless coordinated)
- Starting tunes without asking
- Accompanying slow airs without being asked
- Not leaving space in the music

### Moderately Discouraged

**11. Constant Chord Changes:**
- Irish tunes often stay on one chord for extended periods
- Don't feel obligated to change chords every measure
- Modal tunes can drone on tonic for 8+ bars

**12. Overly Busy Accompaniment:**
- Too many notes, runs, fills
- Drawing attention away from melody
- "Leave holes in the music"
- **Sparse is better**

**13. Ignoring Tune Structure:**
- Not recognizing A/B parts
- Missing key changes between sections
- Not adjusting chords when melody moves

### Instrument-Specific Prohibitions

**Anglo Concertina:**
- Don't sustain chords through bellows change (physically impossible)
- Don't use "chopping" (same finger consecutively)
- Don't play full triads constantly (too awkward)
- Don't bury melody in chords
- Don't play legato when staccato is more natural

**Diatonic Accordion:**
- Don't play bass on every downbeat (too heavy)
- Don't use chord buttons continuously
- Don't ignore bellows direction constraints
- Don't play dense harmony (destroys modal character)
- Don't accompany in session unless asked (many players never use bass)

### Programming Error Prevention

```
IF chord_about_to_play conflicts_with melody_note:
    THEN use_power_chord OR change_chord OR play_nothing
    
IF unfamiliar_with_tune = TRUE:
    THEN drone_on_tonic OR play_nothing
    
IF melody_instrument_count < 3:
    THEN reduce_volume by 30%
    
IF tune_pass_number = 1:
    THEN play_sparse OR drone_only
    
IF mode = modal AND chord_contains_leading_tone:
    ERROR = "Destroys modality"
    THEN use_power_chord OR correct_modal_chord
```

}
```

### Mode Detection Algorithm

```python
def detect_mode(melody_notes, key_signature):
    tonic = identify_tonic(melody_notes)
    scale_degrees = extract_scale_degrees(melody_notes, tonic)
    
    has_flat_7 = (scale_degrees contains b7)

### Chord Selection Algorithm

```python

    # Analyze melody for implied harmony
    strong_notes = extract_strong_beats(melody_phrase)
    
    for note in strong_notes:
        # Find which chord contains this note
        if note in chord_tones(I):
            current_chord = I
        elif note in chord_tones(IV):

        elif note in chord_tones(bVII):
            current_chord = bVII
        # etc.
    
    # Check for conflicts
    if melody_note conflicts chord_third:
        return power_chord(root, fifth)  # Omit third
    else:
        return full_chord
```

### Timing Algorithm by Tune Type

```python
def determine_chord_timing(tune_type, mode):
    if tune_type == "jig":
        min_duration = 2_bars
        typical_duration = 4_bars
        bass_timing = "chord_changes_only"
        chord_button_timing = [beat_3, beat_6]
        strumming = "DOWN-up-down DOWN-up-down"
        
    elif tune_type == "reel":
        min_duration = 2_bars
        typical_duration = 4_bars
        if mode in ["Mixolydian", "Dorian", "Aeolian"]:
            can_stay_on_tonic = 8_bars
        bass_timing = "chord_changes_only"

        strumming = "swung_dotted_rhythm"
        
    # etc. for other tune types
    
    return timing_parameters
```

### Instrument-Specific Voicing

```python
def voice_chord(chord, instrument, bellows_direction):
    if instrument == "anglo_concertina":
        # Check bellows direction availability
        if chord == "D" and bellows_direction == "draw":
            return buttons([C3_draw, G1_draw])  # D + A (D5)
        elif chord == "G" and bellows_direction == "press":
            return buttons([G3_press, C4_press, G4_press])  # G + B + D
        
        # Maximum duration: 1-2 beats before bellows change
        max_duration = 2_beats
        articulation = "staccato"
        
        # If chord unavailable in current direction:
        if chord not in available_in_direction(bellows_direction):
            return find_alternate_melody_fingering()
            OR return bass_note_only()
        
    elif instrument == "diatonic_accordion":
        # Bass button system
        if chord in available_bass_buttons:
            if first_time_on_chord:
                play_bass_button()
            play_chord_button_on_offbeats()
        else:
            return None  # Don't play unavailable chords
        
        # Many traditional players use NO bass
        if style == "traditional" and context == "session":
            return None  # Melody only with ornamentation
```

### Sparse Accompaniment Decision Tree

```python
def calculate_harmony_density(pass_number, tune_complexity, mode):
    base_density = 0.5  # 50%
    
    if pass_number == 1:
        base_density *= 0.3  # Very sparse first time
    
    if tune_complexity == "high":
        base_density *= 0.5  # Reduce by 50%
    
    if mode in ["Mixolydian", "Dorian", "Aeolian"]:
        base_density *= 0.75  # Modal tunes need less harmony
    
    if melody_density == "high":
        base_density *= 0.6  # Leave space for busy melodies
    
    return min(base_density, 0.8)  # Never exceed 80%

def should_play_harmony(current_phrase):
    density = calculate_harmony_density()
    
    # Random selection weighted by density
    if random() < density:
        return True
    else:
        return drone_or_silence()
```

### Complete Implementation Example

```python
# Example: Processing a D Mixolydian reel for Anglo concertina

inputs = {
    "tune_name": "The Tailor's Twist",
    "key_signature": "D",
    "mode": "Mixolydian",
    "tune_type": "reel",
    "instrument": "anglo_concertina",
    "pass_number": 1
}

# Step 1: Identify available chords
available_chords = ["D", "C", "G", "Am", "Bm"]  # Mixolydian in D
primary_progression = ["D", "C", "D"]  # I - bVII - I
avoid_chords = ["A", "C#dim"]  # V and viio forbidden

# Step 2: Analyze melody phrases
phrase_A1 = bars[1:4]  # First 4 bars
dominant_notes = ["D", "F#", "A"]  # D major triad implied
selected_chord = "D"  # Stay on tonic
duration = 4_bars  # Typical for modal reel

phrase_A2 = bars[5:8]
dominant_notes = ["C", "E", "G"]  # C major triad implied
selected_chord = "C"  # bVII chord (characteristic Mixolydian)
duration = 4_bars

# Step 3: Determine bellows direction from melody
melody_notes_phrase_A1 = [D_draw, F#_draw, A_draw, D_draw...]
bellows_direction = "draw"  # Most notes on draw

# Step 4: Voice chord for Anglo concertina
if selected_chord == "D" and bellows_direction == "draw":
    # D5 power chord on draw
    left_hand = button_G1_draw  # Bass A
    right_hand = button_C3_draw  # D melody
    voicing = "D5"  # Omit third for modal ambiguity
    
# Step 5: Apply vamping pattern (um-pa)
bass_pattern = [
    bar_1_beat_1: bass_note,  # Um
    bar_1_beat_3: None,       # (Melody fills)
    bar_2_beat_1: bass_note,  # Um
    bar_2_beat_3: None
]

# Chord only played briefly on offbeats (pa)
chord_pattern = [
    bar_1_beat_2: chord_staccato,  # Pa
    bar_1_beat_4: chord_staccato   # Pa
]

# Step 6: Check for errors
if "A" in proposed_chords:  # A major is V chord
    raise Error("Cannot use V chord in Mixolydian - destroys mode")
    
if bellows_sustain_duration > 2_beats:
    raise Error("Cannot sustain chord beyond bellows capacity")

# Step 7: Output
output = {
    "chords": ["D (4 bars)", "C (4 bars)"],
    "voicing": "power_chords_D5_C5",
    "bass_pattern": "um-pa on chord changes only",
    "articulation": "staccato",
    "dynamics": "subordinate_to_melody",
    "density": "sparse (first pass)"
}
```

## Quick Reference: Essential Rules

### Top 10 Commandments

1. **Know the tune** - Don't play if you don't know it (drone only)
2. **Melody first** - Harmony is always supportive, never dominant
3. **Modal thinking** - Not functional harmony; use bVII in Mixolydian, major IV in Dorian
4. **Simple is better** - Sparse, clean accompaniment with space
5. **bVII is king** - The most characteristic Irish harmony movement (Mixolydian)
6. **No generic patterns** - Each tune is unique; I-V-vi-IV will fail
7. **Avoid diminished and V7 in modal contexts** - They destroy modal character
8. **Listen more than play** - Space is important; silence is acceptable
9. **Follow, don't lead** - The melody player sets pace and tempo
10. **Power chords for modal tunes** - Omit third to preserve modal ambiguity

### Instrument Quick Tips

**Anglo Concertina:**
- Maximum chord duration: 1-2 beats (bellows limitation)
- Never "chop" (same finger consecutively)
- Cross-row playing reduces bellows changes
- Parallel thirds easiest (adjacent buttons)
- Power chords (root + 5th) work best

**Diatonic Accordion:**
- Bass on chord changes only (not every downbeat)
- Chord buttons on offbeats only
- Many traditional players use NO bass (acceptable)
- Tape thirds off chord buttons for modal sound
- B/C: A major problematic (most notes on pull)

### Mode Quick Reference

- **Mixolydian:** I - bVII - I (never V7)
- **Dorian:** i - IV (major) - i
- **Aeolian:** i - bVII - bVI - bVII
- **Ionian:** I - IV - V - I

### When in Doubt

```
IF uncertain:
    THEN drone_on_tonic OR play_nothing
    
IF first_pass:
    THEN minimal_harmony OR tonic_drone_only
    
IF modal_tune:
    THEN use_power_chords (omit third)
    
IF melody_busy:
    THEN accompaniment_sparse
```
