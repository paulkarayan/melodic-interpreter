30000	52440	Hi, everybody.
53960	55080	How you doing?
55540	56540	I guess you guys all.
57680	58700	Oh, you're great.
58700	60880	You can chat over and back.
61000	61840	Great, great, great.
61940	63060	Oh, great to see you all.
63160	63740	How you doing?
64380	66980	We can chat away while people are coming in.
67100	69220	If you have anything to say, feel free.
69280	69700	Hi, Ren.
69760	70460	Hi, Scott.
70780	71520	Hi, Brenda.
72040	76520	Feel free to chat away until we get started.
78260	81140	It's summer here.
81600	84900	The clock just changed in Dublin, in Ireland.
85200	87560	We just had our clock change.
87560	92080	So we always say there's a grand stretch in the evening.
92300	94940	So today's the first evening with a grand stretch in the evening.
95380	96380	And I don't know.
96480	99940	I'm assuming there's some Irish people, some American people, maybe.
100620	103300	But for any of you not here anyway, it's amazing.
104100	107360	You guys had the clock change in America a few weeks ago.
107420	111560	I think there's always a little bit of a staggeredness.
111640	113780	I missed some of my lessons this week because of it.
113780	116360	You always have to keep an eye on it then a few weeks.
117200	119660	Original sound is going on.
119740	120220	Hang on.
120340	121060	There it is.
121320	121720	Okay.
121920	123000	We have that sorted.
123760	125660	I'm just going to check the waiting room.
128060	128500	Okay.
128640	130020	So I think somebody's letting them in.
130060	131360	Caitlin's probably letting them in.
131460	132140	So that's grand.
132140	133100	I'll keep an eye anyway.
134180	136960	So we'll get started and people can join.
137300	138900	You know, I want to make the most of the time.
141600	146940	If there's anyone that has anything specific that they want out of this workshop, throw it
146940	148020	into the chat there.
148880	153420	More than happy to kind of be specific with people's kind of wishes and things like that.
154360	155240	I'm going to start.
155400	158760	I'm not going to spend too much time on theory kind of things.
158860	160340	I want to get into it practically.
161920	168000	And kind of, I was kind of thinking maybe just of looking at actual like snippets of tunes
168000	174360	and actually kind of figuring out how to do some melodic variation within those.
175240	177300	So that's what I think would be the best.
177400	180920	If that sounds good to you guys, that's what I was thinking of doing.
180920	181400	Yeah.
183420	185340	Yeah, good, good, good.
185800	188100	Um, anyone got anything to say there?
192160	192600	No?
192760	193100	All good.
193460	193740	Okay.
193960	195940	So just a quick kind of a thing.
196140	201760	I guess most of you probably know what melodic variation is, but like what, you know, what
201760	202260	is it?
202400	203400	I am for me.
204440	205700	It's kind of a little bit.
206120	213180	I mean, variation, ornamentation, melodic variation, tune versions, that kind of thing.
213180	214400	You know, what is what?
214500	215400	And there's all blurred.
215580	216580	I think there's blurred lines.
216760	220520	But for the purpose of this, isn't that what Miley Cyrus says?
220860	227480	But for the, for the purpose of this workshop, I think that it's just admit somebody in there.
227480	232380	Um, I think that, you know, ornamentation involves technique.
232900	236820	I think with these melodic variations, there's actually no technique involved.
237440	241640	Um, there's no special skill, um, to be able to do a melodic variation.
241640	244240	It's just varying, um, the melody.
244760	251600	And I, I have a kind of a, a little kind of a system of how to put in ornamentation.
252020	255300	I almost view melodic variation as a kind of ornamentation.
255960	258620	But ornamentation is also a kind of variation.
258620	262400	So it's really like what, you know, what came first kind of thing.
262540	269480	But I have a little kind of a ladder, an ornamentation ladder system that I, I try to implement sometimes for students.
269980	277580	Um, when, when trying to get them to put ornamentation in and goes from your, your lowest rung is your easiest form of ornamentation.
277580	284440	And, you know, which would be different depending on what you find easy compared to somebody else, you know, somebody else might find this thing easy.
284780	286880	Somebody else might not know how to do this thing.
286880	288820	So it's not part of their ladder or anything yet.
289140	293900	But I, when I was starting off with that little system, it's just a simple little system that I have.
294240	302240	Um, I kind of, um, thought that melodic variation or what I sometimes call it long notes, short notes, my own terminology.
302240	305240	Nobody would, nobody else would know what you were talking about if you said that.
305240	315660	But long notes, short notes is finding the long notes and making them into shorter notes or looking at short, a group of short notes and figuring out how to throw in a long note.
315900	318920	That's really kind of what melodic variation is to me.
319220	322160	Um, the, that's the basics of it.
322460	332480	Um, I thought that that was going to be a real easy thing for people because there's not an actual skill, you know, you don't have to know how to do a cut.
332480	334620	You don't know how to do, know how to do a crann.
334620	335760	Um, do you know what I mean?
335760	343200	It's just literally very, this melody, but actually people, my students, I discovered a lot of people find it quite hard.
343520	347900	Um, and it is basically in my mind, it's maths debate.
347900	362340	You know, the, the, the kind of this, the kind of, um, small, uh, on dramatic, you know, kind of little, nice, tasty, little variations.
362340	367980	Not the, the big, crazy, like kind of almost like a jazz variation.
367980	371100	That's gone, you know, the tune is kind of unrecognizable.
371400	376800	But I think in Irish music, more of those little variations there, they're kind of like a little bit like maths.
376800	381280	You know, it's, it's maths with, with feeling is what I always say about, uh, music.
381660	385320	Um, so, um, that's kind of, that's what I would think.
385380	393180	Has anyone any questions about that before we, uh, maybe get stuck into some tunes or anything to add to that?
393180	397040	Oh, and did anyone put anything in chat?
397500	399180	Nothing yet in chat, I don't think.
399260	400440	And nobody waiting to get in.
400920	401580	Okay, good.
401940	403400	Um, I have one thing to say.
403980	404220	Yeah.
405160	412060	I guess for me, melodic variation is difficult because I've learned the tune with sort of muscle memory.
412060	423380	And so, and, and, you know, I'm just getting to the point now where I'm kind of following, I'm playing the tune as I'm hearing it in my head.
423520	428940	And I'm assuming that's kind of where the, the, uh, melodic variation starts to come in.
430080	430560	Yeah.
430740	432180	It's hard, isn't it?
432200	435380	Like, you know, you're, you're, it's the, that's the thing.
435380	440700	Um, are we, are we mostly concertina players or are there non-concertina players?
441600	444060	Uh, any, a, a, a whistle there I see.
444600	444840	Yeah.
445080	447500	Um, I think it doesn't matter either way.
447500	455560	Um, just with concertina especially, um, I feel like that kind of, I play it this way thing.
456120	465200	You have to be very careful because, uh, of, of the, the variety of ways there are to play the bloody thing on that bloody instrument.
465660	468880	Um, so that's the problem, a blessing and a curse.
468880	469600	I always call it.
469600	482780	You could, there's so many different ways to play it, but then when it comes to melodic variation, if you have been kind of keeping yourself adaptable with how you play it on the instrument, and then the melodic variation is probably easier.
483000	495360	Um, so, uh, um, yeah, like it, I suppose it's that thing of getting stuck, but really, I suppose if I, if I look at this now, I, hopefully this will
495360	497120	be helpful for that actually, Scott.
497200	506560	So I'll have, uh, let's see if this is helpful with that just because it does, a lot of it, I find when I'm teaching it, I never learned it this way.
507280	523520	And I'm teaching it kind of going, Oh, I would just do this kind of naturally, you know, like there's nearly no way I would ever play the same phrase twice in a tune in a row, unless it was on purpose.
523520	527180	I nearly couldn't do it, you know, it's almost impossible.
527420	539840	So what I get some of my students to do, like say for instance, now there will be some ornamentation in this, but I'm, I am trying to stick to melodic variation in this, but it's gonna overlap a touch.
539840	549720	Well, let, we will try and really focus on that topic, but for instance, the tune, and you don't have to know these tunes, um, in order for it to, to, to, to, you know, to be, to understand it.
549720	560120	But there's, you know, a tune called, um, the Glantin, um, and it's, it, you know, it's one of these reels that's an A, B, you play the first part once, the second part once.
560120	566200	And, um, so the, and most of those, the first part at least is generally four bars repeated.
566200	571060	So there's re they're really quite repetitive, you know, and this tune, like, you know,
571060	580680	How's that sound by the way?
581580	582220	Any problems?
582400	582700	It's good.
582800	582940	Okay.
583080	584260	So that's the tune.
584580	586060	It's basically that twice.
590120	600860	Exact same thing twice.
600860	609240	And what I find really helps with putting in melodic variation there is, find three different ways to play.
609240	613640	Because that's the bit that's repeating, isn't it?
613640	615360	D, G, B, G.
615360	618740	You know, find a few different ways to play it.
619380	623660	And then every time you come to it, play it different and go around in circles.
623660	627100	I have my students do that for weeks and weeks.
627100	628500	And go around in circles.
628500	638100	And when you suddenly, suddenly you find yourself bored and it won't be for a while, that's when, you know, okay, I'm comfortable with this now.
638100	645880	So it could be just a long D. So the first time, always let the tune exist, let the tune be.
645880	648540	You need to know what the tune is before you vary it.
648540	652620	That was it once.
652620	653620	Now we have it again.
653620	655440	A long D.
655440	659620	And then we have it again.
659620	661160	So it's three times in four bars.
661160	661900	Do you know what I mean?
661900	663960	That's what I mean about these repeating phrases.
663960	673340	When you're going looking in, I mean, we've jumped in quite quickly here, but when, when you're going looking for a place, where do you, where do you put the melodic variation is a question, I suppose.
673340	676780	This is where you find the bit that repeats the bit.
676780	681140	That's like, oh God, am I like, you know, am I going to play this over and over again the same?
681140	683840	No, this is the bit you want to vary.
683840	690680	And you could just find that one part, one, there'll be one in most tunes, there'll be one obvious thing like that.
690680	696560	And you go, okay, I'm going to go in there, look at that, how many ways can I play that?
696560	701920	Outside the scope of this, this workshop, you'll be looking at all your ornamentation as well.
701920	704860	In this workshop, like melodic variation in that is the long D.
704860	708360	So D, the notes are D, G, B, G.
708360	709360	Right.
709360	718280	So now we're going to get rid of the G, the first G, D, G, B, G is going to become D, D, B, G.
718280	720880	So it's maths, the D is now worth the D and the G.
726320	728820	And actually, that's a good first step.
728820	733060	You've got three times of this repeating phrase in four bars.
733060	739440	So first, what you're trying to do is get your brain reacting to what's coming.
739440	740760	It's like a video game.
740760	745000	Here comes this boring bit again, you know, what am I going to do?
745000	750300	It's like, oh God, let's do it, but your brain isn't maybe there yet, depending on what stage
750300	751300	you're at.
751300	757420	So what I get people to do is maybe for eight bars, maybe six times you do the melody.
757420	761560	Or maybe you're going to three times, because you do it for four bars.
761560	762560	I hope that makes sense.
762560	766920	If anybody doesn't understand what I'm saying there, but yeah, it happens three times in
766920	775600	four bars, one, two, three.
775600	777100	That's your four bars, yeah?
777100	780520	So the first three times, you just do the melody.
780520	782740	The second, put in that long note.
782740	784680	It's too quick to be changing yet.
784680	785980	You're not comfortable with it yet.
785980	790920	So do that three times.
790920	796680	Okay, now let's figure out another way.
796680	815020	Well, we have turn the second low D, the second beat of that long low D into a high D.
815020	838100	And then, you know, when you get bored with that going round and round in circles and everything
838100	840300	is like in the proper tempo.
840300	845540	You're playing it with a metronome maybe and then, okay, let's see, can we do it every
845540	858540	second thing?
858540	864200	Do them twice in a row, which gives you kind of your going over, you're moving them along
864200	869180	different four bar kind of sections, you know, you're kind of, and then until, once you're
869180	875860	doing that melodic variation, every bar, then you're kind of doing it, you know, you're
875860	885100	kind of going, and of course, there's more than three ways to do it.
885100	889640	So you start bringing in other ways and you just don't ever go to the second part.
889640	890640	Just play it.
890640	891640	It's a great tune for that.
891640	892640	I use this tune a lot.
892640	894900	I probably thought it to you, Scott.
894900	900020	And then you just go round and round in circles and start to be, just be able to react to
900020	902780	the thing that's coming up to you because that's what it really is.
902780	907660	You know, when you get used to it, that's really what it is, is kind of just, yeah, I'm just
907660	908660	going to check the questions.
908660	911660	And if anyone has any questions or suggestions about that.
911660	918320	So to work on some variation when learning a tune, yeah, it is good to work on it when learning
918320	919320	the tune.
919320	920320	It's different schools of thought.
920320	925680	I know that like Mary Bergen teaches the variations and the ornamentation while people
925680	928040	are learning the tune.
928040	934760	I don't, I really feel like, and who am I to disagree with Mary Bergen, but like it's
934760	936760	a different instrument.
936760	942820	But like for me, I'm kind of like, if you can't play the tune, basically, I don't see
942820	948080	if you've any business putting any ornamentation or variations into it, you know?
948080	952680	Maybe that's, maybe I should rethink it, maybe, maybe not ornamentation, but maybe variation
952680	955440	is good to put into it while you're learning it.
955440	961080	And that might make it just easier for you rather than it be like Scott said, like, you
961080	966120	know, you're stuck in the way you're playing and not stuck, but you play it from muscle memory.
966120	969980	And then putting this variation in is kind of, yeah, it's another way to think about it
969980	971280	for sure.
971280	973080	And that tune is called the Glantan.
973080	975220	Hang on till I write it down.
975220	981540	It's not the road to Glantan, it's just the Glantan, I believe.
981540	985460	And, oh, funny spelling there, but yeah.
985460	990120	So now, when I try varying a tune on the fly, sometimes diverge a little too much from the
990120	992620	melody and lose myself, gag it back to the tune.
992620	993620	Embarrassing.
993620	994620	Yes.
994620	995620	Absolutely.
995620	996620	Happens us all.
996620	1002940	So, you know, I think that work that I've just suggested in the Glantan, that kind of
1002940	1010720	thing is really valuable groundwork to put in at home so that you get used to being able
1010720	1012740	to do these things on the fly.
1012740	1017940	Doing them on the fly, like it's kind of, it's kind of hard.
1017940	1023100	It's kind of a, you know, a bit of, it's kind of advanced moves, you know, especially if
1023100	1029180	you're in a session and you're maybe going a bit faster or not quite the swingy rhythm
1029180	1035340	you like to play at, then things are just harder, you know, and you could maybe practice
1035340	1042940	your, I think keep it, keep it to less things, you know, do one thing per tune first.
1042940	1048460	I mean, that's, you know, set realistic goals, life lessons here on Tune Supply.
1048460	1053900	Set realistic goals, you know, do one thing in several tunes, do one thing in one tune,
1053900	1057100	then do one thing in several tunes, then do one thing in each part.
1057100	1058100	Do you know what I mean?
1058100	1064900	And it's just building it up like that gives you, gives you a, a more, more chance of success
1064900	1068240	and you'll be delighted with yourself, you know?
1068240	1072920	So yeah, so getting yourself back to the tune, I, oh, the other thing that I've been doing,
1072920	1077380	it happens with that, with that comment from Karen, and you know, when you lose it and
1077380	1082100	you can't get back, I find, especially with concertina, but I think this applies to most
1082100	1088240	instruments, that when people start getting out of control, they start playing harder and
1088240	1094040	pumping harder and, and, you know, becoming more tense, and on whatever instrument it is,
1094040	1096920	fingers and bows and whatever become more tense.
1096920	1103380	And I do think that I've tried to train myself on, I play really bad guitar and I've tried
1103380	1113380	to kind of train myself to respond by quietening down and, you know, softening rather than harder.
1113380	1119380	It makes it sound so much worse when you go like, and scraping like, oh, I'm lost and I'm
1119380	1121840	making sure everybody hears it, you know?
1121840	1126840	So trying to just kind of react that way is really good, you know?
1126840	1132520	Could we create a list of types of variations from simple to more complex?
1132520	1139020	Well, you see, Richard, what you're talking about is ornamentation there.
1139020	1143880	So I'm not going to go to, like, octaves are ornamentation in my mind, you know?
1143880	1148060	They are obviously a variation because the word vary, you know?
1148060	1151060	But here I'm looking at melodic variations.
1151060	1156240	So I am going to go through to some tunes now because we've spent maybe 15 minutes there.
1156240	1160320	So we've an hour or so left to look at actual tunes.
1160320	1167360	I am happy to take tune suggestions, but I'm going to start with a few of my own ideas.
1167360	1174020	Because, you know what, I used to play tunes, there's tunes that, you know, you've been playing
1174020	1179580	this music since you were five, you develop different relationships with tunes.
1179580	1183000	Like there's tunes that I used to hate, that I love now.
1183000	1189260	And you just kind of realize, oh, and some of them are tunes that are just so repetitive.
1189260	1194760	But now when I see a repetitive tune, I'm like, oh, this is a tune that I can put loads
1194760	1198880	of ornamentation, it's like wide open for all of it.
1198880	1199880	The battering ram.
1199880	1202840	Okay, we'll have a look at the battering ram in a while.
1202840	1206240	So it leaves it wide open.
1206240	1212440	One of the most repetitive tunes that I know, and the most boring ones, is the, we call it
1212440	1221580	the Superman jig, but Bill Hart's jig, because it's, it sounds like Superman.
1221580	1222580	You know?
1222580	1243900	But it's, that's Bill Hart's jig, or affectionately known as the Superman jig.
1243900	1249540	I do have a blackboard behind me here, and I don't have an S on my computer keyboard actually,
1249540	1254720	so I'm going to use a Z, oh dear.
1254720	1259580	I have four computers though, this is just the one, all the other ones have an S.
1259580	1268540	So, so Bill Hart's, just looking at that, like, you know, if you take the melody, I tried,
1268540	1273680	GoFundMe to buy you an S, I tried to get an S, there is no way to get an S on this.
1273680	1275860	I copy and paste my S's.
1275860	1282680	So, if we wrote down, I mean, now we're getting to the point, okay, what is the actual melody?
1282680	1288960	Is it like the, oh, I, I, I, for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to say that the melody
1288960	1302560	is all those long notes.
1302560	1307460	You know, so there's loads of long notes there, but it, it's not really a huge jump.
1307460	1309960	I mean, maybe I won't go into this one too much, it's too simple.
1309960	1324960	So, you know, it's not a huge jump to be going.
1324960	1327960	So, I got rid of every single long note there.
1327960	1331960	None of it was, and there was absolutely no skill involved.
1331960	1332960	Zero.
1332960	1334960	All I did was the maths.
1334960	1339960	Now, if any, I mean, that, it's pretty simple there, but I, I won't go through it all.
1339960	1343960	But just so that you have it, I mean, you know, I, I think you, you probably get that.
1343960	1347960	But just because it is a workshop, God, how am I going to, how am I going to do this?
1347960	1348960	This is going to be fun.
1348960	1352960	Um, maybe I should have moved that chair.
1352960	1353960	Okay.
1353960	1355960	Now, I wonder, can you see that blackboard?
1355960	1356960	I think you can.
1356960	1357960	Yeah.
1357960	1359960	Maybe I'm going to bring this closer.
1359960	1360960	Okay.
1360960	1371960	So, and I will, I'll bring it even closer actually.
1371960	1377960	And, so the, if we go D and I, and so we're in groups of three because it's a jig.
1377960	1379960	D, D, A, A.
1379960	1383960	So I'll just deal with like literally little phrases like that.
1383960	1384960	D, D, A, A.
1384960	1385960	This is word two.
1385960	1386960	These are word three.
1386960	1387960	This is two, three.
1387960	1392960	You know, so it just becomes D, E, D, A, G, A, B.
1392960	1394960	And the same the whole way through.
1394960	1396960	So that's the absolute basics of it.
1396960	1399960	You know, I think you can all probably do that.
1399960	1404960	And D, D, A, D, I mean, then it's kind of like, well, what else could you do?
1404960	1406960	You know, that's a melodic variation.
1406960	1411960	You know, you could do, you know, you could do chords and you can do octaves and you can do,
1411960	1414960	but they're not melodic variation as I see it.
1414960	1416960	So for D, so.
1424960	1427960	I would do a low A instead of the E there.
1427960	1429960	That's another variation.
1429960	1430960	D, A, D.
1430960	1433960	And there's where your music theory comes in a little bit.
1433960	1437960	You could, it's good to have a little mild bit of music theory for this.
1437960	1441960	So, you know, we're in the key of D something or other.
1441960	1447960	And just to know that the notes, the chords in the key and the notes in the chords.
1447960	1454960	So just a quick, I know most people know that, but the chords in the key.
1454960	1456960	Now this is kind of D mixolydian.
1456960	1458960	So it doesn't really follow that.
1458960	1464960	But in D major, D minor, it's D, it's one, four and five, D, G and A.
1464960	1466960	If anyone doesn't understand that, that's fine.
1466960	1470960	And this is going to be D's and C's because it's what's called mixolydian.
1470960	1473960	It goes from the D to the C to the, isn't it?
1473960	1474960	Or it's modal or something.
1474960	1476960	Anyway, it doesn't matter too much.
1476960	1481960	But if we, the main thing is the chord of D is one, three and five, D, F and A.
1481960	1485960	And so D and A, you know, this is basically a D sound.
1485960	1489960	This long D, D is a long sound of D.
1489960	1493960	And so the low A is going to work because that's part, that note is part of the chord.
1493960	1498960	And so that's low D, E, D, D, A, D, probably D, C, D is going to work.
1498960	1506960	It's going to not, a note above the main note and a note below, usually are options.
1506960	1511960	So we have D, E, D, D, C, D.
1511960	1516960	I don't like it as much, but there's no denying it works, you know?
1516960	1523960	So now we have like one, two, three and D, C, D, four melodic ways of playing it.
1523960	1526960	And none of them are rocket science, you know?
1526960	1530960	But it's just a case of getting your brain to start thinking like that.
1530960	1532960	That's all it is, you know?
1532960	1536960	So now if I, now if I go through the whole tune with this phrase.
1536960	1551960	You know what I mean?
1551960	1555960	Immediately, immediately it sounds more interesting to the ear.
1555960	1557960	And it's not, we've done nothing.
1557960	1559960	We've done next to nothing, you know?
1559960	1561960	And all the rest of the notes I kept the same.
1561960	1568960	So really don't, I suppose one message here is don't get bogged down in technique.
1568960	1572960	It's so, it's so, there's such little things that can make.
1572960	1574960	And then if we do the same to this one.
1574960	1576960	So we have AGA.
1576960	1581960	I actually, I really, like this topic I find really interesting, you know?
1581960	1586960	But like, so AGA, I wonder what an A, I think this one's going to be harder.
1586960	1592960	I don't think an A, so we said the note below and the note above the main note.
1592960	1596960	So if the main note here was D, E is above it and C is below it.
1596960	1600960	Here we have A, G is below it and we know that works.
1600960	1601960	But will B work?
1601960	1609960	It works, but it's kind of iffy because there's a B coming soon after it melodically.
1609960	1618960	So we have D, you'd want to be very sure of which note is the note that has the beat,
1618960	1619960	you know?
1619960	1621960	So that kind of thing.
1621960	1631960	A is a note in the chord of D, D, F and A, we said one, three and five.
1631960	1635960	So I'm figuring that a low D might work here.
1635960	1637960	So A, B, A, yeah, sure.
1637960	1643960	And A, D, A is going to work.
1643960	1648960	Because that, and it's, again, they're all going to work with varying levels of,
1648960	1649960	you know, taste is a factor.
1649960	1651960	You might not like it as much.
1651960	1656960	You kind of start to, a lot of melodic variation, you get a feel for what works and what doesn't
1656960	1657960	work.
1657960	1662960	So now, now we have a scenario where we have four ways to play this and four ways to play
1662960	1665960	this without ever touching ornamentation yet.
1665960	1672960	We haven't brought in crayons or rolls or cuts or, do you know what, or harmony notes.
1672960	1674960	So now we get to mix and match.
1674960	1677960	So we're really in a good position here.
1677960	1678960	We go.
1678960	1690960	And so we do mix and match.
1690960	1706960	We do this one with this one and this one with this one.
1706960	1710960	And, you know, that's really increases the number of ways you can play it.
1710960	1712960	And it's kind of like, holy moly.
1712960	1715960	Like, do you actually need to do anything else at that point?
1715960	1718960	You know, it's just so much going on then.
1718960	1722960	And for your brain, like I was struggling there a little bit, like just playing that through,
1722960	1725960	going, oh God, which one am I going to do with that one next?
1725960	1728960	You know, and you know, there's, there's a lot going on there.
1728960	1734960	So, um, I, I, I look like that's, but you're, I will get a little bit more complicated than
1734960	1735960	this as well.
1735960	1740960	But, uh, just kind of, it's a good introduction to kind of what actually can be done with so
1740960	1742960	little, um, of anything.
1742960	1745960	So does anyone have any questions about that?
1745960	1751960	Um, I can move on to maybe the second part of the tune as well.
1751960	1753960	Um, but is that clear?
1753960	1757960	And is there any, if there's any part of that, like, like you were complete, like on, what
1757960	1758960	is she talking about?
1758960	1760960	Please don't hesitate to ask, you know?
1760960	1767960	Brenda, um, I was wondering if, um, uh, after some practice, it ever comes easier to you
1767960	1772960	because right now looking at this, it seems like you have to very intense, intently think
1772960	1775960	about, you know, what are the options.
1775960	1779960	And so almost you sort of map out, like, these are the different options.
1779960	1782960	And this is, then I think about where to put them in.
1782960	1784960	No, it becomes natural.
1784960	1789960	I mean, you know, you guys, I presuming most of you are adult learners, um, you know, this
1789960	1794960	immersion, I never had to think about it, you know, ever.
1794960	1796960	I only think about it when I'm teaching.
1796960	1804960	Um, I think about it in a, in a, like, uh, this is the whole thing I think about when
1804960	1806960	I'm playing traditional Irish music.
1806960	1808960	If I'm in a session, this is all I'm thinking about.
1808960	1810960	That's what, this is what it's all about.
1810960	1815960	Like, to me, this is where, once you get beyond the, once you get to a certain point
1815960	1819960	of being able to play okay, this is it, to me.
1819960	1821960	You know, this is what you're in the session.
1821960	1823960	You're hearing the person beside you go.
1823960	1827960	Like, for instance, Sean Clawsey, a good friend of mine in Boston.
1827960	1830960	Like, there's a tune called The Boys of the Town.
1830960	1840960	And Sean is the best crack for playing a session.
1840960	1843960	And he's just, he's got such lift in his music.
1843960	1847960	And once, and you're sitting beside him and you're like, and he, he did this thing.
1847960	1849960	And he did, so the tune is.
1853960	1856960	And he did, this is where you're going into the big jazzy, but it's not crazy, but I would
1856960	1857960	never think of it.
1857960	1861960	And he just did.
1861960	1864960	So yeah, your ending point, you're landing on that low G.
1864960	1869960	And now I, I never play that tune without doing that, you know, but nobody else I've
1869960	1872960	ever heard doing it, you know, or the likes of playing with Michelle.
1872960	1877960	So this is, this is what I'm sitting in a session, listening to the other person.
1877960	1880960	And what, on the other instruments, it's not going to constantly play fiddle.
1880960	1885960	And, and you're kind of like picking up, you know, that's the freedom of it and the fun.
1885960	1889960	And maybe to have a few drinks and it's even better.
1889960	1894960	And, you know, but the, another one is Michelle O'Brien.
1894960	1898960	I played with her a lot and I, she plays old John's jig.
1898960	1914960	And so the very, the, she puts in a great one again, a big, another big one kind of thing.
1914960	1926960	And here she, she, instead of that, she does.
1926960	1932960	Now, you could say that's three cramps, but you could do that without cramps.
1932960	1950960	You could do, you know, and that, so now you've got, you know, it's so different, but you're, you're at your landing point.
1950960	1954960	What I always say when you're doing any ornamentation, but variation as well.
1954960	1956960	It's Cotton Eye Joe.
1956960	1957960	Where did you come from?
1957960	1958960	Where did you go?
1958960	1959960	Where are you going?
1959960	1960960	Where have you come from?
1960960	1964960	Where is that last note before this variation is happening?
1964960	1966960	Root yourself in that.
1966960	1969960	Figure out your variation on its own.
1969960	1971960	And then where are you going?
1971960	1974960	What's the next note out of that variation?
1974960	1976960	Out of the changed thing.
1976960	1978960	This is ornamentation or variation.
1978960	1979960	This will work.
1979960	1985960	Make sure that you're able and this will help with, oh, I'm in the session and I do a big variation.
1985960	1987960	I get lost and I can't find my way back.
1987960	1988960	That rooting yourself.
1988960	1990960	I'm not finished answering your question, Lulu.
1990960	1991960	I just got waylaid.
1991960	1999960	But yeah, so all of that is interesting, but the answer to your question, the fuller answer
1999960	2006960	or the end of the answer to your question, Lulu, is I think that all of that work is really important to do
2006960	2013960	because then, especially as adult learners, I think that then it starts to bring it in naturally.
2013960	2015960	I'm working with students at the moment with adults.
2015960	2027960	I teach a lot of adult students and I'm working with quite a few of them on trying to get into that natural way of being able to do ornamentation and variations.
2027960	2031960	And these exercises, you won't always have to do that.
2031960	2035960	You know, this music of ours is not that complicated.
2035960	2038960	Like, you know, we're not playing crazy keys.
2038960	2040960	We're in D, G and A and E minor and A minor.
2040960	2041960	You know what I mean?
2041960	2043960	So it crosses over.
2043960	2045960	We're playing mostly jigs and reels.
2045960	2052960	So it crosses over, but it's definitely worth putting that work in for a while.
2052960	2057960	And the reward then is you see it start to cross over and it starts to become easier.
2057960	2066960	But it can be a bit boring and it can be hard if you don't know how or where to go, like how to go about it, I suppose, on your own.
2066960	2071960	So, um, so yeah, um, that answered that question.
2071960	2072960	Yeah.
2072960	2073960	Anybody else?
2073960	2075960	Um, okay.
2075960	2078960	I might look at the second part of this real quick.
2078960	2083960	Um, or yeah, then move on to a real, um, or the battering ram.
2083960	2084960	We could look at two.
2084960	2085960	Let's see.
2085960	2088960	So, um, the blackboard isn't very big.
2088960	2095960	So there's not room for many phrases, but, um, it's kind of cool to do just, uh, so the second part,
2095960	2098960	so the second part of that tune is so boring.
2098960	2110960	Oh God, because it's just such a dose of, it's basically, it's basically some long notes and all that stuff that we're bored of already from the first part.
2110960	2111960	Do you know what I mean?
2111960	2116960	Cause, cause it's.
2116960	2119960	Here's the second part.
2119960	2122960	And again.
2122960	2124960	And again.
2124960	2126960	It's two bars.
2126960	2127960	It's awful.
2127960	2128960	You know?
2128960	2129960	So you have, like, oh my God.
2129960	2130960	You really have to vary it.
2130960	2134960	Um, and I'm going to take off my jumper cause it's warm here.
2134960	2137960	Um, so that second part is actually even more interesting.
2137960	2139960	So you've got, I'm going to write it.
2139960	2140960	I'm going to write it smaller.
2140960	2154960	So you have D and if you can't see it, um, I think Caitlin gives me your emails after or whatever.
2154960	2161960	C, A, B, A, G, A, B, C.
2161960	2162960	So it's C natural.
2162960	2167960	So long, short, long, short, da, da, da, da, da, da.
2167960	2168960	Okay.
2168960	2170960	And it does that four times basically.
2170960	2171960	You know?
2171960	2174960	The long, short, long, short happen four times.
2174960	2177960	So actually what I can do is make it bigger.
2177960	2182960	Because what we'll be looking at is the D, B, C, A.
2182960	2183960	That's the repeating bit.
2183960	2189960	So find your, if you're looking for a system, a logical system, which is how my brain works,
2189960	2191960	find a, find the repeating bit.
2191960	2192960	And this is it.
2192960	2193960	D, B, C, A.
2193960	2197960	Now, obviously we've got, we can fill in this.
2197960	2200960	D to B, there's an obvious note in between.
2200960	2201960	Have a think what it is.
2201960	2203960	Of course, it's going to be C.
2203960	2204960	D, C, B.
2204960	2208960	C to A, the note that lies in between is B.
2208960	2210960	C, B, A.
2210960	2211960	Okay.
2211960	2216960	So now you have kind of, because then you can mix and match these two, you know?
2216960	2219960	And, and that way, and that way, and that way, and that way, you know?
2219960	2221960	So that all already opens it up.
2221960	2223960	Can you see properly?
2223960	2224960	Yeah?
2224960	2225960	Okay.
2225960	2232960	So now let me get the concertina because you can do so much by looking at it.
2232960	2233960	That's melodic variation.
2233960	2234960	You know?
2234960	2235960	That's just melody.
2235960	2236960	D.

2279960	2280960	D.
2280960	2281960	D.
2281960	2282960	Dленas and D.
2282960	2283960	D.
2283960	2290760	Tina but let's have a little look oh yeah the obvious one is on some
2290760	2299460	instruments you can double up D D B C C A so just two high D's see see again
2299460	2305720	could be instrument specific maybe I you know I don't see why not
2313960	2325540	you can go to the D the whole time that's still no skill there's no technique
2325540	2329640	there that's still just melodic variation you know and again some
2329640	2336480	instruments I can't imagine a fiddle would do it but you know definitely D D
2336480	2344760	no D no D C no D no D so these are all you know easy very obvious variations
2344760	2350600	instrument specific variations to you know oh that's a bit of a weird one but
2350600	2354520	it's it could work on many instruments and let me just play it through and see
2354520	2366280	if any other ones come yeah I mean you can hang on you can hang on to a
2366280	2371080	note so say you made the C I got rid of the A and hold the C for three so now
2371080	2378860	you could do D B D D B D B I'll play it in a minute and then C for the whole lot
2378860	2384200	needs you have to have attitude to do that you can't just play a little kind of
2384200	2389140	beige C you have to play it and mean it you know if you're gonna hang on to notes
2389140	2393620	you need to mean it so now this becomes
2393620	2399320	swell your notes you know kind of leave it hanging so I'll put it in it I'll
2399320	2403700	play the tune a bit and put it in later into the tune so I'll play them all
2403700	2429480	you know conversely you can do it with the high D and it's literally just it's
2429480	2435860	actually simpler it's getting rid of notes you know but I would never do a D C
2435860	2441100	you'd have to pair them up with with three notes and the other one you know
2441100	2447580	so yeah so does that make make sense there we we still are on melodic
2447580	2451600	variation we haven't gone to ornamentation at all and there's quite a
2451600	2455900	lot there I think you'll agree right and it's again it's not rocket science it's
2455900	2462860	just trying to get your brain thinking that way and so and any questions there
2462860	2470800	or will I move on maybe to a real but the B part of it's not useful in this I mean
2485900	2490040	do you know what I mean that's the repeat so there I went and find the repeating
2490040	2502040	part so in the four bars of it it doesn't have a repeating thing and so everything
2502040	2506780	repeats the second time around that four part four bars so the only thing really
2506780	2514020	it's not quite a useful learning or teaching exercise for in that so it's B
2514020	2526620	D D C sharp D so divide it into groups of four it's B D D C sharp D E F that's the
2526620	2530720	two groups of four and so then it's just like oh just change the C sharp to an E
2530720	2546380	or change it to a B and a low low G on concertina some of these things work and
2546380	2551240	they might not work on other things so that's the kind of em this it's me again it's not quite
2551240	2557600	a useful one so I'll I'll move on any other suggestions or questions yeah could you play
2557600	2563540	that the bill hearts jig through yeah of course yeah completely and then that helps me a lot to
2563540	2568700	be able to hear it back and yeah I'll play it and I'll play it through and try and stick to
2568700	2575660	melodic variations as opposed to as opposed to ornamentation so I'm gonna play it I'll play
2575660	2580580	the first part straight and I'm gonna get to the second part I'll play the second part straight as well
2580580	2592920	I'm gonna play it well
2592920	2622900	Thank you.
2622920	2652900	This old long notes, short notes, like, you know, in this tune, we're looking at long notes and we're most, like, we started out with a long D and everything else really is making that, those long notes into short notes, apart from these attitude ones at the end where we're creating an even long note.
2652900	2672800	When you get short notes and you turn them into long notes, then that opens up space, in concertina anyway, and I think in other instruments, it opens up space for things like harmony notes, for crans, for rolls, for triplets that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do.
2672800	2678660	And that's another step along then, you know, you've created that space for another kind of ornamentation.
2678920	2685060	So you can see where the, it kind of gets a bit blurred as to what, what is ornamentation and what is variation.
2685060	2692540	So yeah, so anybody else move on?
2693700	2698440	Yeah, I'll go on to a reel because it's, jigs are, I think, sometimes less fun.
2698440	2702880	Um, what, is there anything else that I was going to say?
2706820	2713260	Yeah, if you want to look at, like, so crazy variation, if you want, um, a YouTube, have you a question, Jim?
2714140	2716160	Or is your hand just up accidentally?
2716160	2728700	Exactly. Um, so, uh, if, if, uh, you want to look at, uh, variations, Tommy Potts, Ronan Brown has a series of Tommy Potts, uh, videos on YouTube.
2728700	2735900	Um, one of them is My Love Is In America, and there's all of them, they're all, like, that kind of variation is insane.
2736460	2747600	Like, you know, there's, like, he makes major tunes into minor keys, and he changes the, the time signature of things, you know?
2748040	2754660	But it is very interesting to listen to, and you can, like, to me, this is where the creativity in the music is.
2754660	2767540	And, with, if you look at videos like that, um, and hear, listen to the playing of Tommy Potts, the fireman, the fireman fiddler, um, you will really hear, like, somebody's creativity really in full flow, you know?
2767540	2768960	It's absolutely insane.
2769380	2774420	Um, but it's kind of, like, he's amazing, so he can do that.
2775300	2777660	But it's, like, oh my god, what, you know?
2777720	2784500	And I think another, I think Aidan Connolly, the fiddle player, is, uh, very interesting for variations like that as well.
2784500	2786420	Where you're kind of like, oh my god, you know?
2786700	2794900	But the, the important thing then is to be able to root yourself, in all of this, to be able to root yourself back in the tune and find the tune again.
2795620	2800020	Um, and so, it's funny that, that, uh, I, I think, I can't remember who it was, I said it at the start.
2800420	2803260	Um, oh, my touch screen isn't working.
2803900	2805740	Um, oh, Karen, I think it was, yeah.
2806080	2813320	Um, that it does kind of, um, it does kind of help to really root yourself in the tune, and that knowledge of the tune is so important.
2813320	2824200	Um, let's look at, um, like, you know, let's just have a quick interlude, before we go back to simpler variations, of a couple of crazy ones.
2824280	2827700	Like, you know, like, um, that tune.
2827700	2839480	Um, no idea what it's called.
2839880	2847380	Um, but like, there's something Michal always did in that, like, that, and I, I do, it, it suits a couple of tunes.
2847460	2852020	Like, I don't know, I can't figure out what they are, but when you get to that point, it's like what you were saying, Lulu.
2852020	2855240	When you get to that point in that tune, you're like, oh, that, that will work here.
2855320	2857020	So, basically, it's kind of funny when he goes.
2857020	2879840	Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
2879840	2890280	you know it's a real mad kind of you know you know so you're really changing
2890280	2895260	up the maths the whole you're not just changing you're changing the melody for
2895260	2899280	quite some time and then getting back to it it's you know this is what I think
2899280	2903600	that these little steps that you do really set you up to be able to go in
2903600	2907460	and do more and more and of course listening to the person you want to
2907460	2911540	sound like is a good thing you know the part and what what variations they do
2911540	2917360	and that that's going to be really helpful but that again in situ
2919460	2925240	all right so I need to play the tune twice I need to play the first part twice
2937460	2946700	you know it's kind of crazy it's a crazy little air I love it though and when
2946700	2952700	you're in a session it's a really nice a nice little variety thing and so and
2952700	2960660	things I think reels I mean I have historically worked on and you know the
2960660	2967080	Sally Gardens and the has anyone been to any of these you know the Sally Gardens
2967080	2971220	the Star of Munster are really interesting tunes to work on but people
2971220	2975360	might have done those with me before I'm not sure if has anyone done those with me
2975360	2983260	before oh there's a new message let's see the scar to Glen let me look and see
2983260	2991300	what it's like dude dude scared to Glen oh that's what it is oh yeah thank you
2991300	3000660	didn't even know the name of it when it was shown to me and okay so and another
3000660	3018980	one then it's even kind of just fun to pick a tune and just see what happens
3018980	3026260	rather than have it like swinging on a gate could be a good one and let's have
3026260	3032080	a look and see oh yeah there is kind of fun things that you know swinging on it
3032080	3036400	most people seem to know swinging on a gate right so like it's I think it's kind
3036400	3056140	of a nice chamber so we've two of those and then we have so we've three C a B G's
3056140	3073180	one two three do you know what I mean so that's first step to identify the
3073180	3077560	repeating the repeating boring bit I mean here that that I think it's quite
3077560	3081340	charming that that repeated C a B G especially the two at the end that
3081340	3087160	happen close together it's kind of nice confusing for students though and
3087160	3094960	hmm sometimes there's in a chin like for me that's quite a huge feature of this
3094960	3100900	tune that little for that phrase of notes isn't it I'm not gonna go crazy
3100900	3105340	varying that like to the extent that I did with the other one
3105340	3114220	with the C a B G though I would definitely vary that so right there and
3114220	3122560	C a B G and you don't need you don't need many ways you know you just need a few
3122560	3131080	ways so that you're not doing it over and over again the same way so C a B G it's
3131080	3136120	four short notes first step let's make a long note you heard me doing it already
3136120	3147320	C B G okay now that's more interesting that opens it up in concertina for some
3147320	3152560	for some harmony notes so now maths one two three four we're in real time so now
3152560	3159700	we have the C taking up the A spot the A is gone C B G and I'll remember whatever
3159700	3165040	happened before it's staying the same and whatever after it's A G E G is staying
3165040	3170380	the same you know it's a B most of the time coming before it it could be
3170380	3175300	different no it's always a it's a B until the end and then it's a G coming
3175300	3180220	before it so and now we've C B G okay let's see what hat what's another way
3180220	3196360	because now I can play play different twice there in the end I'm actually
3196360	3203500	hearing a longer C now so this is a a little bit more of an advanced move so
3203500	3209200	you have you want to keep things the same but we want to make this C into three so
3209200	3216700	it wants to take up the the B as well so now one two three will this work will a
3216700	3225520	G work going into the A because it's an A G E G after it and so I'll play it the
3225520	3239260	normal way first or the G doesn't sound good to me there what often happens I
3239260	3245080	find is that when you take up the second spot you move it along and you you kind
3245080	3250620	of that becomes there then and so if I if I put that B in and get rid of that G
3250620	3258000	all together that because C to A is a kind of a natural fall in the scale C B A
3258000	3270000	are our natural descending things so so now I have instead of the G doesn't
3270000	3274780	sound as good that second option there the B sounds much better so now I can
3274780	3278740	play that like it's actually more interesting to play the second to like
3278740	3290440	the second four bars of it so you know and you can just play it different every
3290440	3294600	time and that's that's you can play them in different spots I don't know if
3294600	3301060	there's anything note substitution get rid of that a and replace it with a D
3301060	3306940	that's gonna work and you kind of sometimes I get my students to suggest
3306940	3312160	a note and you you might suggest it based on logic and theory and then you
3312160	3315940	go to players there's only one way to find out if it works it's going to play
3315940	3326060	it you know so C D B G definitely works and on here it is
3326060	3335000	and I think a G will work I think it would sound nice because we're in the key
3335000	3340040	of G and I think a return to a G both times will work so not only one way to
3340040	3354680	find out I think you'll agree that sounds pretty good you know and I wonder is
3354680	3367100	there any other note there's another variation that yeah like so CG worked
3367100	3372560	because we're in the key of G so G I G is gonna kind of work my G's are funny I've
3372560	3389720	been told over and over and so I mean you could also do C D back to your C B kind
3389720	3395660	of almost taken from this one from the big long C the beginning and ending the
3395660	3401060	same but the inner notes just a bit different so let's see what that sounds
3401060	3411720	like so that works too but it's just not the tune but you could get you can do
3411720	3415180	that once you know and that's fine you don't want to do it every time you don't
3415180	3437660	want to get stuck oh this is how I play it now you know that's all of them played
3437660	3442140	they're just in the second four bars of that eight bar because you but you have
3442140	3449020	the other one as well so that you know that's quite again no skill involved the
3449020	3455700	only skill and is is you know trying to figure out I'm playing around with it you
3455700	3461160	know it's that does that make sense is that of any interest or of any use to you
3461160	3467040	it's all small things looking at the key is good for that one there you know the
3467040	3472980	C G B G and that one is good for you know you kind of go okay what why would
3472980	3480840	you go back to a G that definitely works and it I know you said I'm a battering
3480840	3485520	around but is anyone another real and maybe just for the crack maybe you know
3485520	3489280	it's because that's what it's real life is like oh here's a real what how do we
3489280	3493040	you know rather than me having something prepared this is a little bit more
3493040	3499820	interesting and I hear you say the Eaton Derry say again the Eaton Derry or oh so
3499820	3506880	many yeah a lot of has a lot of um repetition in it as I recall yeah totally does so the
3506880	3518340	Eaton Derry is you know that's the first part I'm kind of going with a lot of first parts here
3518340	3527960	but that B A G and Eaton Derry I'll put some of those names up that Eaton Derry is a weird little
3527960	3537120	town in Westmeath that I I don't know if I've ever been to it and it's only up the road and so the Eaton Derry
3537120	3546740	it's the tune the repeating bit like I said just said if that's the bit you find B A G B G G B A G B A G
3546740	3562740	B A G happens three times it's similar to all of these it happens three times in four bars so six times in the first part alone you need a way to play it differently you know and so B A G B G G
3562740	3580360	first thing I do with concertina is play the B twice take up the second space with another B just yeah it's it's I don't know if it works on all instruments
3580360	3596360	you know so that's a nice easy way to break it up into its four and get the math sorted out B B A G won't work for all instruments I don't think
3596360	3608980	um and then it's kind of like you know okay well we're turning a long note into short notes so now let's you look at the note substitution so I mean
3608980	3617560	that's another thing I didn't talk about the other time if you let's look at these two B's you can sub out both of them
3617560	3624940	actually the most easy and instinctive one to sub out is the second one so a high D like we're in the key of G
3624940	3632820	now the the notes in the chord of G are G B and D one three and five so B is the third in the in the in the key
3632820	3641520	of G so G B and D so I'm gonna say that a G or a B a G or a D is also going to work here so let's write
3641520	3648060	them both down and let's hear how they sound so B D and everything stays the same after so you don't even
3648060	3670980	have to think about that and then B G a G okay so they all work you know and low D might work B D a G
3670980	3678120	maybe not as as well that one could be like weird wouldn't work in all instruments yeah not as much
3678120	3687240	uh now it's got the other option is to substitute the first one and the way that works is there's
3687240	3694200	only one way to do that you pick the note and it's probably like a slide in a whistle or a or a fiddle
3694200	3699380	maybe that you're sliding up to the note you pick the note below the main note so here we have a B
3699380	3706700	we're gonna pick the A and the second note is you landing on the main note so A B and the second
3706700	3714120	ones the other notes stay the same so now you have I'll play them true so so I'll just play the
3714120	3722880	normal and the last one just for now and you can hear it's got a different feel it's kind of like
3722880	3732140	a slide up to it like a whistle or a fiddle would do so anytime you have a long note divided into into
3732140	3738480	its two beats you can survive usually the second note has a ton of options related to the chord of
3738480	3744600	the of the key we're in and then the first one you can always do a little slide up to it and the note
3744600	3750200	below but no other note really will work there in that first position so that's kind of an interesting
3750200	3773440	one and and let me see if there's any other way so I play I play the tune just so you can you know and
3773440	3778560	that's all in one spot in the tune you can do the same to other spots you know and then suddenly you've
3778560	3784380	got far more and again not a single bit of ornamentation there or just melodic variation so
3784380	3793260	you know and I know that people are into ornamentation and a plug and I promise you that my ornamentation
3793260	3799740	website that I've been talking about for oh maybe a feckin decade at this point is actually nearly ready
3799740	3804840	to go live and at the moment it's concertina but there'll be other instruments on it too and it'll just
3804840	3810660	be all about approaching ornamentation and how to get ornamentation including melodic variation and
3810660	3817440	into your music and how to just a kind of a guide that will bring you through repetition and you know
3817440	3824820	it can be boring and then there's moments of excitement when you get it and you get used to it and so
3824820	3834600	that's it's called the ornamentation hive I'm hoping to get it online April May and so um but that's the
3834600	3839580	Eden Derry and somebody said Gehen's or the Bear Island the Bear Island
3839580	3867120	you know it's the same principles you're just trying to you've got a Bear Island is a fussy tune you know
3867120	3875400	it's it's not got repeating and phrases in that first part it's all different it's a great tune
3875400	3886800	and but you're looking for a place and it's all short notes so find a long note you know DBC a becomes D
3886800	3896400	C a becomes D D C do you know what I mean you've moved it along we did that already and before that
3896400	3902160	we we didn't so I'll just write it out quickly why not and just and again you know you don't need
3902160	3919680	to know any of these tunes the bit we're looking at is D B C a B D D and so on D that's a C sharp get
3919680	3932680	rid of the B D C A and then D we want to get rid of the C but the A is not going to work I just know
3932680	3940140	and you'll go because the next note is a B D down to C do you see these things repeat like you know
3940140	3947160	it's actually kind of boring you know like it's not once you realize once you see it you're like oh yeah
3947160	3952560	you she did that already she moved a note along got rid of that one and then it turned out that
3952560	3958500	the following note meant that the three sequences of notes are scaled downwards so that no we did
3958500	3963540	that already you know and so that kind of thing just becomes instinct because there's no way you're
3963540	3968040	going to go through it in your head every time do you know it's like it just becomes boring and
3968040	3980520	you're like but it's nice to play it you know and again that one that's held for one two three needs
3980520	4004880	to have attitude you know okay there we have a long note just turn it into short notes I think 90% of
4004880	4010760	this melodic variation thing is just long note short notes as I call it that whole system of finding
4010760	4015080	your long notes turn them in short notes find your short notes and try and create long notes you know
4015080	4021500	that's a really good baseline kind of thing to do and I don't know the beauties of autumn the Gihan's
4021500	4027440	reel I'm not sure what that is either and but I can look them up why not it's kind of fun like you know
4027440	4033920	and you can kind of try and find little little patches like that in your own tunes that you're
4033920	4042320	working on at the moment and let's see what's Gihan's it's is it Tommy Gihan let's have a look
4042320	4051000	it's I have a feeling it's a GUI is it that's how we spell Gihan over here little little dope I'll put
4051000	4060960	in G-E-E-H-A-N and see what comes up oh I won't spend too long because we're nearly at the end
4060960	4063540	I can play the first few notes
4063540	4066060	sure
4066060	4074420	oh it's Eileen O'Callaghan's is it this one
4074420	4079000	yeah I have it here hang on till I see what it is
4079000	4089060	I don't
4089060	4093840	very close
4093840	4103860	oh yeah Michal plays that one
4109000	4119060	yeah I mean it's the same thing it's the same the same theory really I maybe I won't go into it
4119060	4127120	because I'm not that sure the tune it might be just a bit of a so let's have a look like if you
4127120	4137180	if you that's the first phrase you know do do do do do do do bump up but is that that's really you know
4137180	4143360	that's it's gonna be the same thing you get yes once you see me do a few of these you're like oh
4143360	4152420	yeah this is actually really boring and G sorry G I'm surprised I can get a whole workshop out of it
4152420	4166480	B G D G B A D G B A so we have a long note we're in the key G yeah you know you can figure out how to
4166480	4172240	three ways to find out what key you're in look at the last note of a eight bar thing works 90% of
4172240	4179240	the time but not all the time and try and record yourself playing the tune play it back and try and
4179240	4183220	play a G along with it or an A along with it and if it sounds right it's probably in that key of it
4183220	4191540	sounds wrong it's probably not and if your ear is terrible god help you and and but looking at the
4191540	4197180	notes in it like you know the C naturals and the key and you know that these are all like every
4197180	4203900	single note there except the A is in the corner of G G B and D they're all you know that's so we
4203900	4216320	know where the key of G now we G B G D G B A G B so let's do the move along trick again so we did G for
4216320	4224300	two so we make it last for three that G then this is a real typical example now we have another G we
4224300	4231500	can't hold it for four I mean we can but you need serious attitude for that so that's that's a real
4231500	4237860	typical example of moving the B along you know and and more than the other ones the other two examples
4237860	4241400	that we did and if you asked me what the other two examples were I wouldn't be able to tell you now
4241400	4250960	but I know we did that twice already G B D you know and and sorry B and then this stays the same the
4250960	4255140	whole way down you know you're kind of rooting yourself so that you know where to get back to
4255140	4271940	so because or I mean the other thing that I did the first step usually is a G G you know just to
4271940	4277700	divide it into its four but I play it like I that's part of my style is to play that like a double G up
4277700	4284540	nearly all the time and and then it's it's a funny one because it's not going back to the G here it's
4284540	4293780	here so you can't do a G F G I mean you could do what I would do there is base my my little short note
4293780	4302340	very variations on this a lot of the three G taking up three notes rather than two so now I can do G F G
4302340	4308040	and stick with the B and that's going to work going back into that so that's my that's what I would
4308040	4324120	base that on so you've got do you know what I mean so whereas it would be hard to vary that too much
4324120	4331400	I needed to get this done first which is funny I didn't it it happened instinctively I didn't because
4331400	4337640	that's kind of nearly in other ones of other examples I would wait till down here before
4337640	4342440	showing you that but it's something in me knew that I had to do that in order to get any more
4342440	4348920	kind of variation so you can see how it kind of starts to you just kind of get a feel for it as
4348920	4356060	well definitely you know and start listening to to all those people and that you like whose music you
4356060	4360920	like and that you think you want to sound like you know and that's what I did if I you know I
4360920	4367280	spoon-feed my students I spoon-feed the hell out of them I'm like Jesus Christ nobody ever spoon-fed me
4367280	4374540	like this and but what I did was I for an hour or two every night I sat with me Hall O'Reilly's music
4374540	4381260	because that's who I liked and I I there was no slow down or thing it was cassette and just write
4381260	4386420	down every little thing I could hear him doing and there's no substitute for that just to go in
4386420	4393620	the what are they doing and like I didn't really ask him but like if my students ask me what did
4393620	4399420	you do there I'm so happy and I will tell them but like most hardly any of my students do that you
4399420	4406280	have to there's a few where they're like really like fully like realize that that's it like that
4406280	4412460	you have to like really toothpick fine-tooth comb not a toothpick a fine-tooth comb and go through
4412460	4423020	it and GBBG let's see yeah it's okay I wouldn't do it instinctively definitely not incorrect might
4423020	4429680	work on other instruments better than mine yeah I you could put a little cut between it then if you're
4429680	4435960	going into the ornamentation territory yeah I kind of like it that's kind of one I wouldn't have
4435960	4443180	thought of so yeah um so yeah um any questions there that's probably I mean you get the idea yeah
4443180	4449560	is it did was it all stuff you know already or did that help at all
4449560	4460800	okay good good good I hope so but um it helps to break it all down yeah I mean it's it is that's
4460800	4465640	basically what it is when you actually kind of go for it feel free to unmute there if you want to say
4465640	4474180	anything but um it's kind of you know it's there's a bit of drudgery there for sure that you have to go
4474180	4479980	through but you can see that even in the future what did we do five tunes there's repetition already
4479980	4488460	in the in the thing that we did you know uh it's instinctive for me um but you have your kind of
4488460	4496580	patterns and your you know each person has their patterns and their things they do um for sure um
4496580	4502800	it wouldn't necessarily yeah Jim so basically what we're looking for is flexibility
4502800	4512420	and not uh pre-arranged arrangements that we learned that just play those arrangements in a
4512420	4519620	non-varied way well yeah a bit of both like as children we compete in the flas and the flas is
4519620	4527200	um you arrange your flat tune so I suppose you know if you think of it like a a person born here
4527200	4532260	playing this music you know I would have arranged all my flat tunes but you're also
4532260	4537860	in sessions kind of instinctively learning it but there's definitely no harm in arranging your tunes
4537860	4544320	um but also to put in this kind of I don't know even maybe the knowledge of this might help
4544320	4551800	rather but I find with my students that it's it's the skill to be able like you're trying like that
4551800	4558000	video game analogy these obstacles coming towards you is really quite a good one for how you want your
4558000	4565760	brain to be working you know that oh oh I'm not I'm not good you know it's not wrong it's not wrong to play
4565760	4575480	and you know actually I probably the first time around the tune would play it would play it like
4575480	4591020	that you know and then start to put slight variations in and you just get kind of an instinct for it but
4591020	4597220	you have the instinct isn't enough if you're not able to react I suppose and it is kind of it is kind
4597220	4603120	of like that so the training of reacting um I think is really important and for adult learners is what I'm
4603120	4608580	really looking at you know this is more applicable to adult learners than to children really who
4608580	4617180	absorb things like feckin you know sponges curses curses of god on them all um but yeah yeah a
4617180	4621520	combination Jim I would say anybody else any questions or anything to add
4621520	4631100	yes yeah so I know the whole idea I think a lot of this is to avoid for formulas and to um um avoid
4631100	4641820	boredom and um but um um not to get a formula but how in terms of the variations and also ornaments
4641820	4649240	in playing let's say one particular tune do you have a certain um general philosophy or
4649240	4654860	um about how how you build a tune you know like you said just said you start maybe the first time
4654860	4660720	through playing it the basic you know historic notes that you learned and then how do you build it
4660720	4668440	is it just a linear progression where you yeah I build it from I mean on my instrument um you have
4668440	4674960	you know I'd be inclined to put in simple harmony notes in within the same octave of the uh of the tune
4674960	4682840	before then putting you know uh lower octave bulkier things in I would be hanging on to chords or to
4682840	4689160	crans for a while I wouldn't be too I'd be keeping them for a little bit later in the tune and I think
4689160	4694640	that's not I'm not I wouldn't be too unique in that I think that would be quite common to let the tune
4694640	4701700	breathe and then let it be delicately kind of decorated and then uh you know go create go all out
4701700	4705880	you know the third time around or whatever or towards the end kind of thing that's what I
4705880	4712560	I I'm you know I'm t any of my kids that I'm teaching um with their flat tunes that's kind of
4712560	4718720	what I'm trying to get them to do like I try to not I hate the idea that at the flat now the tune has
4718720	4725740	been arranged for them so they learn it that way I want them to I want to give them you know 10 ways
4725740	4729860	of playing that 10 ways of playing that bit there that bit there that bit there now you have all these
4729860	4735220	ways of playing that you put it together you know and I think that's really um more useful but they
4735220	4742320	they they probably won't win because I'm not make making it into this scientific project that they
4742320	4746680	just know how to do this because like I hate the fact that kids now you know a lot of them just know
4746680	4752220	this amazing flat tune in F minor and but they can't play like the silver spear you know I just hate
4752220	4758480	it it's awful um so yeah I must teach them all the silver spear this week actually I'm always saying
4758480	4763260	that and I never teach it because it's kind of hard actually on concertina but um yeah so there's
4763260	4769740	there's loads uh loads but I think really before going too crazy with any of the um ornamentation
4769740	4775580	before going too crazy with ornamentation look at what you can do with just no technique whatsoever
4775580	4781480	it's amazing you don't need you don't need to be afraid of ornamentation and thinking of oh god it's
4781480	4786400	all these techniques I have to learn I can't do it do that first get your brain doing that first
4786400	4791020	that's going to make your brain better going to make it more able to do the ornamentation when
4791020	4797900	it comes up you know and then and then you've got the world is your oyster you know and really work
4797900	4803980	on one tune find your tune that you're playing find your little bits in it that are um that are
4803980	4810760	repetitive figure out a way to play them and play it different every eight bars or four bars or two bars
4810760	4816100	or one bar when you're on one bar you're able to do it you know that would be the the kind of way I
4816100	4824440	would uh approach it hi Kathy um yeah I would approach it that way so yeah uh anybody else
4824440	4834240	well okay um so so but the the I guess also a matter of taste so the final time around on a tune
4834240	4839020	you you wouldn't necessarily it wouldn't be linear that's probably by the time you get to the last
4839020	4845900	time around the basic melody is unrecognizable and no one knows where you started from no definitely
4845900	4851060	not like I'll play that I'll play the um superman jig as if I was playing it the second time around so
4851060	4852020	you know we're kind of
4852020	4857180	you know
4857180	4862340	you know
4862340	4867460	you know what I mean so you might
4867460	4895180	you know what I mean so you might go a little bit off piste but not crazy you
4895180	4900060	know so it's still recognized I'm you know people have different styles Tommy Potts is going to be
4900060	4904060	playing it and you're like what the hell is that Tony DeMarco you're like what's that Paul
4904060	4908600	McNevin what is what's that chin ah you're gonna know what tune I'm playing people are different
4908600	4914700	you know you're gonna know the tune you're gonna it's recognizable as that tune you know so yeah
4914700	4919220	can't say those names outside what happens in tune supply stays in tune supply
4919220	4928160	but those guys are great like that they're they've got jazz heads on them I you know that
4928160	4931800	we the rest of us can't keep up with them is basically what's happening you're like what
4931800	4938100	what is that and they're you know flying around the place so yeah I suppose we can wrap it up
4938100	4945660	there it's Sunday night I should probably relax um and uh enjoy the rest of your Sundays and
4945660	4952560	I believe that Caitlin if um I'll put my email address up there sure why not and if any of you
4952560	4960340	want to be on my concertina mailing list or on my ornamentation hive uh mailing list sure you can drop
4960340	4972900	me a line on this oh it oh I've got no um I've got no s hang on I know I just have to do the copy
4972900	4978180	pasting again I know that the tune supply password is copied and pasted there's copy okay now I can do
4978180	4986420	it so the can you take a look at my cat you should have me on your list already right Brenda I think
