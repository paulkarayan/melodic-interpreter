1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,440
Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,080
How you doing?

4
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,540
I guess you guys all.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,700
Oh, you're great.

6
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,880
You can chat over and back.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Great, great, great.

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,060
Oh, great to see you all.

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,740
How you doing?

10
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,980
We can chat away while people are coming in.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,220
If you have anything to say, feel free.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,700
Hi, Ren.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,460
Hi, Scott.

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,520
Hi, Brenda.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,520
Feel free to chat away until we get started.

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,140
It's summer here.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,900
The clock just changed in Dublin, in Ireland.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,560
We just had our clock change.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,080
So we always say there's a grand stretch in the evening.

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,940
So today's the first evening with a grand stretch in the evening.

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
And I don't know.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,940
I'm assuming there's some Irish people, some American people, maybe.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,300
But for any of you not here anyway, it's amazing.

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,360
You guys had the clock change in America a few weeks ago.

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,560
I think there's always a little bit of a staggeredness.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,780
I missed some of my lessons this week because of it.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,360
You always have to keep an eye on it then a few weeks.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,660
Original sound is going on.

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,220
Hang on.

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,060
There it is.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,720
Okay.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
We have that sorted.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,660
I'm just going to check the waiting room.

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,500
Okay.

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,020
So I think somebody's letting them in.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,360
Caitlin's probably letting them in.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,140
So that's grand.

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,100
I'll keep an eye anyway.

39
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,960
So we'll get started and people can join.

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,900
You know, I want to make the most of the time.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,940
If there's anyone that has anything specific that they want out of this workshop, throw it

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,020
into the chat there.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,420
More than happy to kind of be specific with people's kind of wishes and things like that.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm going to start.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm not going to spend too much time on theory kind of things.

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,340
I want to get into it practically.

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,000
And kind of, I was kind of thinking maybe just of looking at actual like snippets of tunes

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,360
and actually kind of figuring out how to do some melodic variation within those.

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,300
So that's what I think would be the best.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,920
If that sounds good to you guys, that's what I was thinking of doing.

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,400
Yeah.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
Yeah, good, good, good.

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,100
Um, anyone got anything to say there?

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,600
No?

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,100
All good.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,940
So just a quick kind of a thing.

58
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,760
I guess most of you probably know what melodic variation is, but like what, you know, what

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,260
is it?

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I am for me.

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,700
It's kind of a little bit.

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,180
I mean, variation, ornamentation, melodic variation, tune versions, that kind of thing.

63
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,400
You know, what is what?

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,400
And there's all blurred.

65
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
I think there's blurred lines.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,520
But for the purpose of this, isn't that what Miley Cyrus says?

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,480
But for the, for the purpose of this workshop, I think that it's just admit somebody in there.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,380
Um, I think that, you know, ornamentation involves technique.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,820
I think with these melodic variations, there's actually no technique involved.

70
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,640
Um, there's no special skill, um, to be able to do a melodic variation.

71
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,240
It's just varying, um, the melody.

72
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,600
And I, I have a kind of a, a little kind of a system of how to put in ornamentation.

73
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,300
I almost view melodic variation as a kind of ornamentation.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,620
But ornamentation is also a kind of variation.

75
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,400
So it's really like what, you know, what came first kind of thing.

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,480
But I have a little kind of a ladder, an ornamentation ladder system that I, I try to implement sometimes for students.

77
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,580
Um, when, when trying to get them to put ornamentation in and goes from your, your lowest rung is your easiest form of ornamentation.

78
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,440
And, you know, which would be different depending on what you find easy compared to somebody else, you know, somebody else might find this thing easy.

79
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,880
Somebody else might not know how to do this thing.

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,820
So it's not part of their ladder or anything yet.

81
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,900
But I, when I was starting off with that little system, it's just a simple little system that I have.

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Um, I kind of, um, thought that melodic variation or what I sometimes call it long notes, short notes, my own terminology.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Nobody would, nobody else would know what you were talking about if you said that.

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:15,660
But long notes, short notes is finding the long notes and making them into shorter notes or looking at short, a group of short notes and figuring out how to throw in a long note.

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,920
That's really kind of what melodic variation is to me.

86
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,160
Um, the, that's the basics of it.

87
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:32,480
Um, I thought that that was going to be a real easy thing for people because there's not an actual skill, you know, you don't have to know how to do a cut.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,620
You don't know how to do, know how to do a crann.

89
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,760
Um, do you know what I mean?

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,200
It's just literally very, this melody, but actually people, my students, I discovered a lot of people find it quite hard.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,900
Um, and it is basically in my mind, it's maths debate.

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:06:02,340
You know, the, the, the kind of this, the kind of, um, small, uh, on dramatic, you know, kind of little, nice, tasty, little variations.

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,980
Not the, the big, crazy, like kind of almost like a jazz variation.

94
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,100
That's gone, you know, the tune is kind of unrecognizable.

95
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,800
But I think in Irish music, more of those little variations there, they're kind of like a little bit like maths.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,280
You know, it's, it's maths with, with feeling is what I always say about, uh, music.

97
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,320
Um, so, um, that's kind of, that's what I would think.

98
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:33,180
Has anyone any questions about that before we, uh, maybe get stuck into some tunes or anything to add to that?

99
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh, and did anyone put anything in chat?

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,180
Nothing yet in chat, I don't think.

101
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,440
And nobody waiting to get in.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,580
Okay, good.

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,400
Um, I have one thing to say.

104
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,220
Yeah.

105
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,060
I guess for me, melodic variation is difficult because I've learned the tune with sort of muscle memory.

106
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:03,380
And so, and, and, you know, I'm just getting to the point now where I'm kind of following, I'm playing the tune as I'm hearing it in my head.

107
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,940
And I'm assuming that's kind of where the, the, uh, melodic variation starts to come in.

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah.

109
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,180
It's hard, isn't it?

110
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,380
Like, you know, you're, you're, it's the, that's the thing.

111
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,700
Um, are we, are we mostly concertina players or are there non-concertina players?

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,060
Uh, any, a, a, a whistle there I see.

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,840
Yeah.

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,500
Um, I think it doesn't matter either way.

115
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:35,560
Um, just with concertina especially, um, I feel like that kind of, I play it this way thing.

116
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,200
You have to be very careful because, uh, of, of the, the variety of ways there are to play the bloody thing on that bloody instrument.

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,880
Um, so that's the problem, a blessing and a curse.

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,600
I always call it.

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:08:02,780
You could, there's so many different ways to play it, but then when it comes to melodic variation, if you have been kind of keeping yourself adaptable with how you play it on the instrument, and then the melodic variation is probably easier.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,360
Um, so, uh, um, yeah, like it, I suppose it's that thing of getting stuck, but really, I suppose if I, if I look at this now, I, hopefully this will

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
be helpful for that actually, Scott.

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:26,560
So I'll have, uh, let's see if this is helpful with that just because it does, a lot of it, I find when I'm teaching it, I never learned it this way.

123
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:43,520
And I'm teaching it kind of going, Oh, I would just do this kind of naturally, you know, like there's nearly no way I would ever play the same phrase twice in a tune in a row, unless it was on purpose.

124
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,180
I nearly couldn't do it, you know, it's almost impossible.

125
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:59,840
So what I get some of my students to do, like say for instance, now there will be some ornamentation in this, but I'm, I am trying to stick to melodic variation in this, but it's gonna overlap a touch.

126
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:09,720
Well, let, we will try and really focus on that topic, but for instance, the tune, and you don't have to know these tunes, um, in order for it to, to, to, to, you know, to be, to understand it.

127
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:20,120
But there's, you know, a tune called, um, the Glantin, um, and it's, it, you know, it's one of these reels that's an A, B, you play the first part once, the second part once.

128
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,200
And, um, so the, and most of those, the first part at least is generally four bars repeated.

129
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,060
So there's re they're really quite repetitive, you know, and this tune, like, you know,

130
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:40,680
How's that sound by the way?

131
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,220
Any problems?

132
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,700
It's good.

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:42,940
Okay.

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,260
So that's the tune.

135
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,060
It's basically that twice.

136
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:00,860
Exact same thing twice.

137
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:09,240
And what I find really helps with putting in melodic variation there is, find three different ways to play.

138
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,640
Because that's the bit that's repeating, isn't it?

139
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,360
D, G, B, G.

140
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,740
You know, find a few different ways to play it.

141
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,660
And then every time you come to it, play it different and go around in circles.

142
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,100
I have my students do that for weeks and weeks.

143
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,500
And go around in circles.

144
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:38,100
And when you suddenly, suddenly you find yourself bored and it won't be for a while, that's when, you know, okay, I'm comfortable with this now.

145
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,880
So it could be just a long D. So the first time, always let the tune exist, let the tune be.

146
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,540
You need to know what the tune is before you vary it.

147
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,620
That was it once.

148
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
Now we have it again.

149
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,440
A long D.

150
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,620
And then we have it again.

151
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,160
So it's three times in four bars.

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,900
Do you know what I mean?

153
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,960
That's what I mean about these repeating phrases.

154
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:13,340
When you're going looking in, I mean, we've jumped in quite quickly here, but when, when you're going looking for a place, where do you, where do you put the melodic variation is a question, I suppose.

155
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,780
This is where you find the bit that repeats the bit.

156
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,140
That's like, oh God, am I like, you know, am I going to play this over and over again the same?

157
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,840
No, this is the bit you want to vary.

158
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,680
And you could just find that one part, one, there'll be one in most tunes, there'll be one obvious thing like that.

159
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,560
And you go, okay, I'm going to go in there, look at that, how many ways can I play that?

160
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,920
Outside the scope of this, this workshop, you'll be looking at all your ornamentation as well.

161
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,860
In this workshop, like melodic variation in that is the long D.

162
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,360
So D, the notes are D, G, B, G.

163
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Right.

164
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:58,280
So now we're going to get rid of the G, the first G, D, G, B, G is going to become D, D, B, G.

165
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,880
So it's maths, the D is now worth the D and the G.

166
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,820
And actually, that's a good first step.

167
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,060
You've got three times of this repeating phrase in four bars.

168
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:19,440
So first, what you're trying to do is get your brain reacting to what's coming.

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
It's like a video game.

170
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Here comes this boring bit again, you know, what am I going to do?

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,300
It's like, oh God, let's do it, but your brain isn't maybe there yet, depending on what stage

172
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
you're at.

173
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,420
So what I get people to do is maybe for eight bars, maybe six times you do the melody.

174
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,560
Or maybe you're going to three times, because you do it for four bars.

175
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I hope that makes sense.

176
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,920
If anybody doesn't understand what I'm saying there, but yeah, it happens three times in

177
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:55,600
four bars, one, two, three.

178
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
That's your four bars, yeah?

179
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,520
So the first three times, you just do the melody.

180
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,740
The second, put in that long note.

181
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,680
It's too quick to be changing yet.

182
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,980
You're not comfortable with it yet.

183
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,920
So do that three times.

184
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,680
Okay, now let's figure out another way.

185
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:35,020
Well, we have turn the second low D, the second beat of that long low D into a high D.

186
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:58,100
And then, you know, when you get bored with that going round and round in circles and everything

187
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,300
is like in the proper tempo.

188
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,540
You're playing it with a metronome maybe and then, okay, let's see, can we do it every

189
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:18,540
second thing?

190
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,200
Do them twice in a row, which gives you kind of your going over, you're moving them along

191
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,180
different four bar kind of sections, you know, you're kind of, and then until, once you're

192
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,860
doing that melodic variation, every bar, then you're kind of doing it, you know, you're

193
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:45,100
kind of going, and of course, there's more than three ways to do it.

194
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,640
So you start bringing in other ways and you just don't ever go to the second part.

195
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Just play it.

196
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
It's a great tune for that.

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I use this tune a lot.

198
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,900
I probably thought it to you, Scott.

199
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,020
And then you just go round and round in circles and start to be, just be able to react to

200
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,780
the thing that's coming up to you because that's what it really is.

201
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,660
You know, when you get used to it, that's really what it is, is kind of just, yeah, I'm just

202
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
going to check the questions.

203
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,660
And if anyone has any questions or suggestions about that.

204
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,320
So to work on some variation when learning a tune, yeah, it is good to work on it when learning

205
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
the tune.

206
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
It's different schools of thought.

207
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,680
I know that like Mary Bergen teaches the variations and the ornamentation while people

208
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,040
are learning the tune.

209
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,760
I don't, I really feel like, and who am I to disagree with Mary Bergen, but like it's

210
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
a different instrument.

211
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,820
But like for me, I'm kind of like, if you can't play the tune, basically, I don't see

212
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,080
if you've any business putting any ornamentation or variations into it, you know?

213
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,680
Maybe that's, maybe I should rethink it, maybe, maybe not ornamentation, but maybe variation

214
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,440
is good to put into it while you're learning it.

215
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,080
And that might make it just easier for you rather than it be like Scott said, like, you

216
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,120
know, you're stuck in the way you're playing and not stuck, but you play it from muscle memory.

217
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,980
And then putting this variation in is kind of, yeah, it's another way to think about it

218
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,280
for sure.

219
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,080
And that tune is called the Glantan.

220
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,220
Hang on till I write it down.

221
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,540
It's not the road to Glantan, it's just the Glantan, I believe.

222
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,460
And, oh, funny spelling there, but yeah.

223
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,120
So now, when I try varying a tune on the fly, sometimes diverge a little too much from the

224
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,620
melody and lose myself, gag it back to the tune.

225
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Embarrassing.

226
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Yes.

227
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Absolutely.

228
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Happens us all.

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,940
So, you know, I think that work that I've just suggested in the Glantan, that kind of

230
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:50,720
thing is really valuable groundwork to put in at home so that you get used to being able

231
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,740
to do these things on the fly.

232
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,940
Doing them on the fly, like it's kind of, it's kind of hard.

233
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,100
It's kind of a, you know, a bit of, it's kind of advanced moves, you know, especially if

234
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,180
you're in a session and you're maybe going a bit faster or not quite the swingy rhythm

235
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,340
you like to play at, then things are just harder, you know, and you could maybe practice

236
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:22,940
your, I think keep it, keep it to less things, you know, do one thing per tune first.

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,460
I mean, that's, you know, set realistic goals, life lessons here on Tune Supply.

238
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,900
Set realistic goals, you know, do one thing in several tunes, do one thing in one tune,

239
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,100
then do one thing in several tunes, then do one thing in each part.

240
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Do you know what I mean?

241
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,900
And it's just building it up like that gives you, gives you a, a more, more chance of success

242
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,240
and you'll be delighted with yourself, you know?

243
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,920
So yeah, so getting yourself back to the tune, I, oh, the other thing that I've been doing,

244
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,380
it happens with that, with that comment from Karen, and you know, when you lose it and

245
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,100
you can't get back, I find, especially with concertina, but I think this applies to most

246
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,240
instruments, that when people start getting out of control, they start playing harder and

247
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,040
pumping harder and, and, you know, becoming more tense, and on whatever instrument it is,

248
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,920
fingers and bows and whatever become more tense.

249
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,380
And I do think that I've tried to train myself on, I play really bad guitar and I've tried

250
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:33,380
to kind of train myself to respond by quietening down and, you know, softening rather than harder.

251
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,380
It makes it sound so much worse when you go like, and scraping like, oh, I'm lost and I'm

252
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,840
making sure everybody hears it, you know?

253
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,840
So trying to just kind of react that way is really good, you know?

254
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,520
Could we create a list of types of variations from simple to more complex?

255
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:59,020
Well, you see, Richard, what you're talking about is ornamentation there.

256
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,880
So I'm not going to go to, like, octaves are ornamentation in my mind, you know?

257
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,060
They are obviously a variation because the word vary, you know?

258
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,060
But here I'm looking at melodic variations.

259
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,240
So I am going to go through to some tunes now because we've spent maybe 15 minutes there.

260
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,320
So we've an hour or so left to look at actual tunes.

261
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,360
I am happy to take tune suggestions, but I'm going to start with a few of my own ideas.

262
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,020
Because, you know what, I used to play tunes, there's tunes that, you know, you've been playing

263
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,580
this music since you were five, you develop different relationships with tunes.

264
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,000
Like there's tunes that I used to hate, that I love now.

265
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,260
And you just kind of realize, oh, and some of them are tunes that are just so repetitive.

266
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,760
But now when I see a repetitive tune, I'm like, oh, this is a tune that I can put loads

267
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,880
of ornamentation, it's like wide open for all of it.

268
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
The battering ram.

269
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,840
Okay, we'll have a look at the battering ram in a while.

270
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,240
So it leaves it wide open.

271
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,440
One of the most repetitive tunes that I know, and the most boring ones, is the, we call it

272
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:21,580
the Superman jig, but Bill Hart's jig, because it's, it sounds like Superman.

273
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
You know?

274
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:43,900
But it's, that's Bill Hart's jig, or affectionately known as the Superman jig.

275
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,540
I do have a blackboard behind me here, and I don't have an S on my computer keyboard actually,

276
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,720
so I'm going to use a Z, oh dear.

277
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,580
I have four computers though, this is just the one, all the other ones have an S.

278
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,540
So, so Bill Hart's, just looking at that, like, you know, if you take the melody, I tried,

279
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,680
GoFundMe to buy you an S, I tried to get an S, there is no way to get an S on this.

280
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,860
I copy and paste my S's.

281
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:22,680
So, if we wrote down, I mean, now we're getting to the point, okay, what is the actual melody?

282
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Is it like the, oh, I, I, I, for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to say that the melody

283
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:42,560
is all those long notes.

284
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,460
You know, so there's loads of long notes there, but it, it's not really a huge jump.

285
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,960
I mean, maybe I won't go into this one too much, it's too simple.

286
00:21:49,960 --> 00:22:04,960
So, you know, it's not a huge jump to be going.

287
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
So, I got rid of every single long note there.

288
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,960
None of it was, and there was absolutely no skill involved.

289
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Zero.

290
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
All I did was the maths.

291
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Now, if any, I mean, that, it's pretty simple there, but I, I won't go through it all.

292
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,960
But just so that you have it, I mean, you know, I, I think you, you probably get that.

293
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,960
But just because it is a workshop, God, how am I going to, how am I going to do this?

294
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
This is going to be fun.

295
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Um, maybe I should have moved that chair.

296
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Okay.

297
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Now, I wonder, can you see that blackboard?

298
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I think you can.

299
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Yeah.

300
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Maybe I'm going to bring this closer.

301
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Okay.

302
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:51,960
So, and I will, I'll bring it even closer actually.

303
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,960
And, so the, if we go D and I, and so we're in groups of three because it's a jig.

304
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
D, D, A, A.

305
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,960
So I'll just deal with like literally little phrases like that.

306
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
D, D, A, A.

307
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
This is word two.

308
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
These are word three.

309
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
This is two, three.

310
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,960
You know, so it just becomes D, E, D, A, G, A, B.

311
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
And the same the whole way through.

312
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
So that's the absolute basics of it.

313
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,960
You know, I think you can all probably do that.

314
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,960
And D, D, A, D, I mean, then it's kind of like, well, what else could you do?

315
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
You know, that's a melodic variation.

316
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,960
You know, you could do, you know, you could do chords and you can do octaves and you can do,

317
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
but they're not melodic variation as I see it.

318
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
So for D, so.

319
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I would do a low A instead of the E there.

320
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
That's another variation.

321
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
D, A, D.

322
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
And there's where your music theory comes in a little bit.

323
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,960
You could, it's good to have a little mild bit of music theory for this.

324
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,960
So, you know, we're in the key of D something or other.

325
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,960
And just to know that the notes, the chords in the key and the notes in the chords.

326
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,960
So just a quick, I know most people know that, but the chords in the key.

327
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Now this is kind of D mixolydian.

328
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
So it doesn't really follow that.

329
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,960
But in D major, D minor, it's D, it's one, four and five, D, G and A.

330
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
If anyone doesn't understand that, that's fine.

331
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,960
And this is going to be D's and C's because it's what's called mixolydian.

332
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,960
It goes from the D to the C to the, isn't it?

333
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Or it's modal or something.

334
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Anyway, it doesn't matter too much.

335
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,960
But if we, the main thing is the chord of D is one, three and five, D, F and A.

336
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,960
And so D and A, you know, this is basically a D sound.

337
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,960
This long D, D is a long sound of D.

338
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,960
And so the low A is going to work because that's part, that note is part of the chord.

339
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,960
And so that's low D, E, D, D, A, D, probably D, C, D is going to work.

340
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,960
It's going to not, a note above the main note and a note below, usually are options.

341
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,960
So we have D, E, D, D, C, D.

342
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I don't like it as much, but there's no denying it works, you know?

343
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,960
So now we have like one, two, three and D, C, D, four melodic ways of playing it.

344
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
And none of them are rocket science, you know?

345
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
But it's just a case of getting your brain to start thinking like that.

346
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
That's all it is, you know?

347
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,960
So now if I, now if I go through the whole tune with this phrase.

348
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:51,960
You know what I mean?

349
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Immediately, immediately it sounds more interesting to the ear.

350
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
And it's not, we've done nothing.

351
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
We've done next to nothing, you know?

352
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
And all the rest of the notes I kept the same.

353
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:08,960
So really don't, I suppose one message here is don't get bogged down in technique.

354
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
It's so, it's so, there's such little things that can make.

355
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
And then if we do the same to this one.

356
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
So we have AGA.

357
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,960
I actually, I really, like this topic I find really interesting, you know?

358
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,960
But like, so AGA, I wonder what an A, I think this one's going to be harder.

359
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,960
I don't think an A, so we said the note below and the note above the main note.

360
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,960
So if the main note here was D, E is above it and C is below it.

361
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Here we have A, G is below it and we know that works.

362
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
But will B work?

363
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,960
It works, but it's kind of iffy because there's a B coming soon after it melodically.

364
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,960
So we have D, you'd want to be very sure of which note is the note that has the beat,

365
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
you know?

366
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
So that kind of thing.

367
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:11,960
A is a note in the chord of D, D, F and A, we said one, three and five.

368
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,960
So I'm figuring that a low D might work here.

369
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
So A, B, A, yeah, sure.

370
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,960
And A, D, A is going to work.

371
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Because that, and it's, again, they're all going to work with varying levels of,

372
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
you know, taste is a factor.

373
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
You might not like it as much.

374
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,960
You kind of start to, a lot of melodic variation, you get a feel for what works and what doesn't

375
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
work.

376
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,960
So now, now we have a scenario where we have four ways to play this and four ways to play

377
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
this without ever touching ornamentation yet.

378
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,960
We haven't brought in crayons or rolls or cuts or, do you know what, or harmony notes.

379
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
So now we get to mix and match.

380
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
So we're really in a good position here.

381
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
We go.

382
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:10,960
And so we do mix and match.

383
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:26,960
We do this one with this one and this one with this one.

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,960
And, you know, that's really increases the number of ways you can play it.

385
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
And it's kind of like, holy moly.

386
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Like, do you actually need to do anything else at that point?

387
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
You know, it's just so much going on then.

388
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
And for your brain, like I was struggling there a little bit, like just playing that through,

389
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
going, oh God, which one am I going to do with that one next?

390
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,960
You know, and you know, there's, there's a lot going on there.

391
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,960
So, um, I, I, I look like that's, but you're, I will get a little bit more complicated than

392
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
this as well.

393
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,960
But, uh, just kind of, it's a good introduction to kind of what actually can be done with so

394
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
little, um, of anything.

395
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,960
So does anyone have any questions about that?

396
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Um, I can move on to maybe the second part of the tune as well.

397
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Um, but is that clear?

398
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
And is there any, if there's any part of that, like, like you were complete, like on, what

399
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
is she talking about?

400
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Please don't hesitate to ask, you know?

401
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Brenda, um, I was wondering if, um, uh, after some practice, it ever comes easier to you

402
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,960
because right now looking at this, it seems like you have to very intense, intently think

403
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
about, you know, what are the options.

404
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,960
And so almost you sort of map out, like, these are the different options.

405
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
And this is, then I think about where to put them in.

406
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
No, it becomes natural.

407
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,960
I mean, you know, you guys, I presuming most of you are adult learners, um, you know, this

408
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,960
immersion, I never had to think about it, you know, ever.

409
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I only think about it when I'm teaching.

410
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Um, I think about it in a, in a, like, uh, this is the whole thing I think about when

411
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm playing traditional Irish music.

412
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
If I'm in a session, this is all I'm thinking about.

413
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
That's what, this is what it's all about.

414
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Like, to me, this is where, once you get beyond the, once you get to a certain point

415
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,960
of being able to play okay, this is it, to me.

416
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
You know, this is what you're in the session.

417
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
You're hearing the person beside you go.

418
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Like, for instance, Sean Clawsey, a good friend of mine in Boston.

419
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Like, there's a tune called The Boys of the Town.

420
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:40,960
And Sean is the best crack for playing a session.

421
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,960
And he's just, he's got such lift in his music.

422
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
And once, and you're sitting beside him and you're like, and he, he did this thing.

423
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
And he did, so the tune is.

424
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,960
And he did, this is where you're going into the big jazzy, but it's not crazy, but I would

425
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
never think of it.

426
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,960
And he just did.

427
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,960
So yeah, your ending point, you're landing on that low G.

428
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
And now I, I never play that tune without doing that, you know, but nobody else I've

429
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
ever heard doing it, you know, or the likes of playing with Michelle.

430
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,960
So this is, this is what I'm sitting in a session, listening to the other person.

431
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,960
And what, on the other instruments, it's not going to constantly play fiddle.

432
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,960
And, and you're kind of like picking up, you know, that's the freedom of it and the fun.

433
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,960
And maybe to have a few drinks and it's even better.

434
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,960
And, you know, but the, another one is Michelle O'Brien.

435
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I played with her a lot and I, she plays old John's jig.

436
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:54,960
And so the very, the, she puts in a great one again, a big, another big one kind of thing.

437
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:06,960
And here she, she, instead of that, she does.

438
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Now, you could say that's three cramps, but you could do that without cramps.

439
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:30,960
You could do, you know, and that, so now you've got, you know, it's so different, but you're, you're at your landing point.

440
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
What I always say when you're doing any ornamentation, but variation as well.

441
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
It's Cotton Eye Joe.

442
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Where did you come from?

443
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Where did you go?

444
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Where are you going?

445
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Where have you come from?

446
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Where is that last note before this variation is happening?

447
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Root yourself in that.

448
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Figure out your variation on its own.

449
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
And then where are you going?

450
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,960
What's the next note out of that variation?

451
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Out of the changed thing.

452
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
This is ornamentation or variation.

453
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
This will work.

454
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Make sure that you're able and this will help with, oh, I'm in the session and I do a big variation.

455
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I get lost and I can't find my way back.

456
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
That rooting yourself.

457
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
I'm not finished answering your question, Lulu.

458
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I just got waylaid.

459
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,960
But yeah, so all of that is interesting, but the answer to your question, the fuller answer

460
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,960
or the end of the answer to your question, Lulu, is I think that all of that work is really important to do

461
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,960
because then, especially as adult learners, I think that then it starts to bring it in naturally.

462
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm working with students at the moment with adults.

463
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I teach a lot of adult students and I'm working with quite a few of them on trying to get into that natural way of being able to do ornamentation and variations.

464
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,960
And these exercises, you won't always have to do that.

465
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,960
You know, this music of ours is not that complicated.

466
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Like, you know, we're not playing crazy keys.

467
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
We're in D, G and A and E minor and A minor.

468
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
You know what I mean?

469
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
So it crosses over.

470
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
We're playing mostly jigs and reels.

471
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,960
So it crosses over, but it's definitely worth putting that work in for a while.

472
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,960
And the reward then is you see it start to cross over and it starts to become easier.

473
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,960
But it can be a bit boring and it can be hard if you don't know how or where to go, like how to go about it, I suppose, on your own.

474
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,960
So, um, so yeah, um, that answered that question.

475
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Yeah.

476
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Anybody else?

477
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Um, okay.

478
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,960
I might look at the second part of this real quick.

479
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Um, or yeah, then move on to a real, um, or the battering ram.

480
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
We could look at two.

481
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Let's see.

482
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
So, um, the blackboard isn't very big.

483
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,960
So there's not room for many phrases, but, um, it's kind of cool to do just, uh, so the second part,

484
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,960
so the second part of that tune is so boring.

485
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Oh God, because it's just such a dose of, it's basically, it's basically some long notes and all that stuff that we're bored of already from the first part.

486
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Do you know what I mean?

487
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Cause, cause it's.

488
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Here's the second part.

489
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,960
And again.

490
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
And again.

491
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
It's two bars.

492
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
It's awful.

493
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
You know?

494
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
So you have, like, oh my God.

495
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
You really have to vary it.

496
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Um, and I'm going to take off my jumper cause it's warm here.

497
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Um, so that second part is actually even more interesting.

498
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
So you've got, I'm going to write it.

499
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
I'm going to write it smaller.

500
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:54,960
So you have D and if you can't see it, um, I think Caitlin gives me your emails after or whatever.

501
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,960
C, A, B, A, G, A, B, C.

502
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
So it's C natural.

503
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,960
So long, short, long, short, da, da, da, da, da, da.

504
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Okay.

505
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
And it does that four times basically.

506
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You know?

507
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,960
The long, short, long, short happen four times.

508
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,960
So actually what I can do is make it bigger.

509
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Because what we'll be looking at is the D, B, C, A.

510
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
That's the repeating bit.

511
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,960
So find your, if you're looking for a system, a logical system, which is how my brain works,

512
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
find a, find the repeating bit.

513
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
And this is it.

514
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
D, B, C, A.

515
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Now, obviously we've got, we can fill in this.

516
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
D to B, there's an obvious note in between.

517
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Have a think what it is.

518
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Of course, it's going to be C.

519
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
D, C, B.

520
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,960
C to A, the note that lies in between is B.

521
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
C, B, A.

522
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Okay.

523
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,960
So now you have kind of, because then you can mix and match these two, you know?

524
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
And, and that way, and that way, and that way, and that way, you know?

525
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
So that all already opens it up.

526
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Can you see properly?

527
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Yeah?

528
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Okay.

529
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,960
So now let me get the concertina because you can do so much by looking at it.

530
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
That's melodic variation.

531
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You know?

532
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
That's just melody.

533
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
D.

534
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
D.

535
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
D.

536
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
D.

537
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
D.

538
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
D.

539
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
D.

540
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
D.

541
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
D.

542
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
D.

543
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
D.

544
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
D.

545
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
D.

546
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
D.

547
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
D.

548
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
D.

549
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
D.

550
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
D.

551
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
D.

552
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
D.

553
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
D.

554
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
D.

555
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
D.

556
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
D.

557
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
D.

558
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
D.

559
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
D.

560
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
D.

561
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
D.

562
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
D.

563
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
D.

564
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
D.

565
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
D.

566
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
D.

567
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
D.

568
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
D.

569
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
C.

570
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
D.

571
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
D.

572
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
D.

573
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
D.

574
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
D.

575
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
D.

576
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
D.

577
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
D.

578
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Dленas and D.

579
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
D.

580
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,760
Tina but let's have a little look oh yeah the obvious one is on some

581
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:19,460
instruments you can double up D D B C C A so just two high D's see see again

582
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:25,720
could be instrument specific maybe I you know I don't see why not

583
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:45,540
you can go to the D the whole time that's still no skill there's no technique

584
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,640
there that's still just melodic variation you know and again some

585
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,480
instruments I can't imagine a fiddle would do it but you know definitely D D

586
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:04,760
no D no D C no D no D so these are all you know easy very obvious variations

587
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,600
instrument specific variations to you know oh that's a bit of a weird one but

588
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,520
it's it could work on many instruments and let me just play it through and see

589
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:26,280
if any other ones come yeah I mean you can hang on you can hang on to a

590
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,080
note so say you made the C I got rid of the A and hold the C for three so now

591
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:38,860
you could do D B D D B D B I'll play it in a minute and then C for the whole lot

592
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,200
needs you have to have attitude to do that you can't just play a little kind of

593
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,140
beige C you have to play it and mean it you know if you're gonna hang on to notes

594
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,620
you need to mean it so now this becomes

595
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,320
swell your notes you know kind of leave it hanging so I'll put it in it I'll

596
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,700
play the tune a bit and put it in later into the tune so I'll play them all

597
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:29,480
you know conversely you can do it with the high D and it's literally just it's

598
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,860
actually simpler it's getting rid of notes you know but I would never do a D C

599
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:41,100
you'd have to pair them up with with three notes and the other one you know

600
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:47,580
so yeah so does that make make sense there we we still are on melodic

601
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,600
variation we haven't gone to ornamentation at all and there's quite a

602
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,900
lot there I think you'll agree right and it's again it's not rocket science it's

603
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:02,860
just trying to get your brain thinking that way and so and any questions there

604
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:10,800
or will I move on maybe to a real but the B part of it's not useful in this I mean

605
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,040
do you know what I mean that's the repeat so there I went and find the repeating

606
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:42,040
part so in the four bars of it it doesn't have a repeating thing and so everything

607
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,780
repeats the second time around that four part four bars so the only thing really

608
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:54,020
it's not quite a useful learning or teaching exercise for in that so it's B

609
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:06,620
D D C sharp D so divide it into groups of four it's B D D C sharp D E F that's the

610
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,720
two groups of four and so then it's just like oh just change the C sharp to an E

611
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:26,380
or change it to a B and a low low G on concertina some of these things work and

612
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,240
they might not work on other things so that's the kind of em this it's me again it's not quite

613
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,600
a useful one so I'll I'll move on any other suggestions or questions yeah could you play

614
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,540
that the bill hearts jig through yeah of course yeah completely and then that helps me a lot to

615
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,700
be able to hear it back and yeah I'll play it and I'll play it through and try and stick to

616
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:55,660
melodic variations as opposed to as opposed to ornamentation so I'm gonna play it I'll play

617
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,580
the first part straight and I'm gonna get to the second part I'll play the second part straight as well

618
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:12,920
I'm gonna play it well

619
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:42,900
Thank you.

620
00:43:42,920 --> 00:44:12,900
This old long notes, short notes, like, you know, in this tune, we're looking at long notes and we're most, like, we started out with a long D and everything else really is making that, those long notes into short notes, apart from these attitude ones at the end where we're creating an even long note.

621
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:32,800
When you get short notes and you turn them into long notes, then that opens up space, in concertina anyway, and I think in other instruments, it opens up space for things like harmony notes, for crans, for rolls, for triplets that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do.

622
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,660
And that's another step along then, you know, you've created that space for another kind of ornamentation.

623
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,060
So you can see where the, it kind of gets a bit blurred as to what, what is ornamentation and what is variation.

624
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,540
So yeah, so anybody else move on?

625
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,440
Yeah, I'll go on to a reel because it's, jigs are, I think, sometimes less fun.

626
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,880
Um, what, is there anything else that I was going to say?

627
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:13,260
Yeah, if you want to look at, like, so crazy variation, if you want, um, a YouTube, have you a question, Jim?

628
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,160
Or is your hand just up accidentally?

629
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:28,700
Exactly. Um, so, uh, if, if, uh, you want to look at, uh, variations, Tommy Potts, Ronan Brown has a series of Tommy Potts, uh, videos on YouTube.

630
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:35,900
Um, one of them is My Love Is In America, and there's all of them, they're all, like, that kind of variation is insane.

631
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:47,600
Like, you know, there's, like, he makes major tunes into minor keys, and he changes the, the time signature of things, you know?

632
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,660
But it is very interesting to listen to, and you can, like, to me, this is where the creativity in the music is.

633
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:07,540
And, with, if you look at videos like that, um, and hear, listen to the playing of Tommy Potts, the fireman, the fireman fiddler, um, you will really hear, like, somebody's creativity really in full flow, you know?

634
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,960
It's absolutely insane.

635
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,420
Um, but it's kind of, like, he's amazing, so he can do that.

636
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,660
But it's, like, oh my god, what, you know?

637
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:24,500
And I think another, I think Aidan Connolly, the fiddle player, is, uh, very interesting for variations like that as well.

638
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,420
Where you're kind of like, oh my god, you know?

639
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:34,900
But the, the important thing then is to be able to root yourself, in all of this, to be able to root yourself back in the tune and find the tune again.

640
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,020
Um, and so, it's funny that, that, uh, I, I think, I can't remember who it was, I said it at the start.

641
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,260
Um, oh, my touch screen isn't working.

642
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,740
Um, oh, Karen, I think it was, yeah.

643
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:53,320
Um, that it does kind of, um, it does kind of help to really root yourself in the tune, and that knowledge of the tune is so important.

644
00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:04,200
Um, let's look at, um, like, you know, let's just have a quick interlude, before we go back to simpler variations, of a couple of crazy ones.

645
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,700
Like, you know, like, um, that tune.

646
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:19,480
Um, no idea what it's called.

647
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:27,380
Um, but like, there's something Michal always did in that, like, that, and I, I do, it, it suits a couple of tunes.

648
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,020
Like, I don't know, I can't figure out what they are, but when you get to that point, it's like what you were saying, Lulu.

649
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,240
When you get to that point in that tune, you're like, oh, that, that will work here.

650
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,020
So, basically, it's kind of funny when he goes.

651
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:59,840
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

652
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:10,280
you know it's a real mad kind of you know you know so you're really changing

653
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,260
up the maths the whole you're not just changing you're changing the melody for

654
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,280
quite some time and then getting back to it it's you know this is what I think

655
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,600
that these little steps that you do really set you up to be able to go in

656
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,460
and do more and more and of course listening to the person you want to

657
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,540
sound like is a good thing you know the part and what what variations they do

658
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:37,360
and that that's going to be really helpful but that again in situ

659
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:45,240
all right so I need to play the tune twice I need to play the first part twice

660
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:06,700
you know it's kind of crazy it's a crazy little air I love it though and when

661
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,700
you're in a session it's a really nice a nice little variety thing and so and

662
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:20,660
things I think reels I mean I have historically worked on and you know the

663
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:27,080
Sally Gardens and the has anyone been to any of these you know the Sally Gardens

664
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,220
the Star of Munster are really interesting tunes to work on but people

665
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,360
might have done those with me before I'm not sure if has anyone done those with me

666
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:43,260
before oh there's a new message let's see the scar to Glen let me look and see

667
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:51,300
what it's like dude dude scared to Glen oh that's what it is oh yeah thank you

668
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:00,660
didn't even know the name of it when it was shown to me and okay so and another

669
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:18,980
one then it's even kind of just fun to pick a tune and just see what happens

670
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:26,260
rather than have it like swinging on a gate could be a good one and let's have

671
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:32,080
a look and see oh yeah there is kind of fun things that you know swinging on it

672
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,400
most people seem to know swinging on a gate right so like it's I think it's kind

673
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:56,140
of a nice chamber so we've two of those and then we have so we've three C a B G's

674
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:13,180
one two three do you know what I mean so that's first step to identify the

675
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,560
repeating the repeating boring bit I mean here that that I think it's quite

676
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,340
charming that that repeated C a B G especially the two at the end that

677
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,160
happen close together it's kind of nice confusing for students though and

678
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:34,960
hmm sometimes there's in a chin like for me that's quite a huge feature of this

679
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,900
tune that little for that phrase of notes isn't it I'm not gonna go crazy

680
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,340
varying that like to the extent that I did with the other one

681
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:54,220
with the C a B G though I would definitely vary that so right there and

682
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:02,560
C a B G and you don't need you don't need many ways you know you just need a few

683
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:11,080
ways so that you're not doing it over and over again the same way so C a B G it's

684
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,120
four short notes first step let's make a long note you heard me doing it already

685
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:27,320
C B G okay now that's more interesting that opens it up in concertina for some

686
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,560
for some harmony notes so now maths one two three four we're in real time so now

687
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,700
we have the C taking up the A spot the A is gone C B G and I'll remember whatever

688
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:45,040
happened before it's staying the same and whatever after it's A G E G is staying

689
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,380
the same you know it's a B most of the time coming before it it could be

690
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:55,300
different no it's always a it's a B until the end and then it's a G coming

691
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:00,220
before it so and now we've C B G okay let's see what hat what's another way

692
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:16,360
because now I can play play different twice there in the end I'm actually

693
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,500
hearing a longer C now so this is a a little bit more of an advanced move so

694
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:29,200
you have you want to keep things the same but we want to make this C into three so

695
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,700
it wants to take up the the B as well so now one two three will this work will a

696
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:45,520
G work going into the A because it's an A G E G after it and so I'll play it the

697
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:59,260
normal way first or the G doesn't sound good to me there what often happens I

698
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:05,080
find is that when you take up the second spot you move it along and you you kind

699
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,620
of that becomes there then and so if I if I put that B in and get rid of that G

700
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:18,000
all together that because C to A is a kind of a natural fall in the scale C B A

701
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:30,000
are our natural descending things so so now I have instead of the G doesn't

702
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,780
sound as good that second option there the B sounds much better so now I can

703
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,740
play that like it's actually more interesting to play the second to like

704
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:50,440
the second four bars of it so you know and you can just play it different every

705
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,600
time and that's that's you can play them in different spots I don't know if

706
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:01,060
there's anything note substitution get rid of that a and replace it with a D

707
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,940
that's gonna work and you kind of sometimes I get my students to suggest

708
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:12,160
a note and you you might suggest it based on logic and theory and then you

709
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,940
go to players there's only one way to find out if it works it's going to play

710
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:26,060
it you know so C D B G definitely works and on here it is

711
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:35,000
and I think a G will work I think it would sound nice because we're in the key

712
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,040
of G and I think a return to a G both times will work so not only one way to

713
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:54,680
find out I think you'll agree that sounds pretty good you know and I wonder is

714
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:07,100
there any other note there's another variation that yeah like so CG worked

715
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,560
because we're in the key of G so G I G is gonna kind of work my G's are funny I've

716
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:29,720
been told over and over and so I mean you could also do C D back to your C B kind

717
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,660
of almost taken from this one from the big long C the beginning and ending the

718
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:41,060
same but the inner notes just a bit different so let's see what that sounds

719
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:51,720
like so that works too but it's just not the tune but you could get you can do

720
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,180
that once you know and that's fine you don't want to do it every time you don't

721
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:17,660
want to get stuck oh this is how I play it now you know that's all of them played

722
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:22,140
they're just in the second four bars of that eight bar because you but you have

723
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:29,020
the other one as well so that you know that's quite again no skill involved the

724
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:35,700
only skill and is is you know trying to figure out I'm playing around with it you

725
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,160
know it's that does that make sense is that of any interest or of any use to you

726
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,040
it's all small things looking at the key is good for that one there you know the

727
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,980
C G B G and that one is good for you know you kind of go okay what why would

728
00:57:52,980 --> 00:58:00,840
you go back to a G that definitely works and it I know you said I'm a battering

729
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,520
around but is anyone another real and maybe just for the crack maybe you know

730
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,280
it's because that's what it's real life is like oh here's a real what how do we

731
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,040
you know rather than me having something prepared this is a little bit more

732
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,820
interesting and I hear you say the Eaton Derry say again the Eaton Derry or oh so

733
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:26,880
many yeah a lot of has a lot of um repetition in it as I recall yeah totally does so the

734
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:38,340
Eaton Derry is you know that's the first part I'm kind of going with a lot of first parts here

735
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:47,960
but that B A G and Eaton Derry I'll put some of those names up that Eaton Derry is a weird little

736
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:57,120
town in Westmeath that I I don't know if I've ever been to it and it's only up the road and so the Eaton Derry

737
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:06,740
it's the tune the repeating bit like I said just said if that's the bit you find B A G B G G B A G B A G

738
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:22,740
B A G happens three times it's similar to all of these it happens three times in four bars so six times in the first part alone you need a way to play it differently you know and so B A G B G G

739
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:40,360
first thing I do with concertina is play the B twice take up the second space with another B just yeah it's it's I don't know if it works on all instruments

740
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:56,360
you know so that's a nice easy way to break it up into its four and get the math sorted out B B A G won't work for all instruments I don't think

741
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:08,980
um and then it's kind of like you know okay well we're turning a long note into short notes so now let's you look at the note substitution so I mean

742
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:17,560
that's another thing I didn't talk about the other time if you let's look at these two B's you can sub out both of them

743
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:24,940
actually the most easy and instinctive one to sub out is the second one so a high D like we're in the key of G

744
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:32,820
now the the notes in the chord of G are G B and D one three and five so B is the third in the in the in the key

745
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:41,520
of G so G B and D so I'm gonna say that a G or a B a G or a D is also going to work here so let's write

746
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:48,060
them both down and let's hear how they sound so B D and everything stays the same after so you don't even

747
01:00:48,060 --> 01:01:10,980
have to think about that and then B G a G okay so they all work you know and low D might work B D a G

748
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:18,120
maybe not as as well that one could be like weird wouldn't work in all instruments yeah not as much

749
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:27,240
uh now it's got the other option is to substitute the first one and the way that works is there's

750
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,200
only one way to do that you pick the note and it's probably like a slide in a whistle or a or a fiddle

751
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,380
maybe that you're sliding up to the note you pick the note below the main note so here we have a B

752
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:46,700
we're gonna pick the A and the second note is you landing on the main note so A B and the second

753
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:54,120
ones the other notes stay the same so now you have I'll play them true so so I'll just play the

754
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:02,880
normal and the last one just for now and you can hear it's got a different feel it's kind of like

755
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:12,140
a slide up to it like a whistle or a fiddle would do so anytime you have a long note divided into into

756
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:18,480
its two beats you can survive usually the second note has a ton of options related to the chord of

757
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,600
the of the key we're in and then the first one you can always do a little slide up to it and the note

758
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,200
below but no other note really will work there in that first position so that's kind of an interesting

759
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:53,440
one and and let me see if there's any other way so I play I play the tune just so you can you know and

760
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,560
that's all in one spot in the tune you can do the same to other spots you know and then suddenly you've

761
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,380
got far more and again not a single bit of ornamentation there or just melodic variation so

762
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:13,260
you know and I know that people are into ornamentation and a plug and I promise you that my ornamentation

763
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:19,740
website that I've been talking about for oh maybe a feckin decade at this point is actually nearly ready

764
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,840
to go live and at the moment it's concertina but there'll be other instruments on it too and it'll just

765
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:30,660
be all about approaching ornamentation and how to get ornamentation including melodic variation and

766
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:37,440
into your music and how to just a kind of a guide that will bring you through repetition and you know

767
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:44,820
it can be boring and then there's moments of excitement when you get it and you get used to it and so

768
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:54,600
that's it's called the ornamentation hive I'm hoping to get it online April May and so um but that's the

769
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,580
Eden Derry and somebody said Gehen's or the Bear Island the Bear Island

770
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:27,120
you know it's the same principles you're just trying to you've got a Bear Island is a fussy tune you know

771
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:35,400
it's it's not got repeating and phrases in that first part it's all different it's a great tune

772
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:46,800
and but you're looking for a place and it's all short notes so find a long note you know DBC a becomes D

773
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:56,400
C a becomes D D C do you know what I mean you've moved it along we did that already and before that

774
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,160
we we didn't so I'll just write it out quickly why not and just and again you know you don't need

775
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:19,680
to know any of these tunes the bit we're looking at is D B C a B D D and so on D that's a C sharp get

776
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:32,680
rid of the B D C A and then D we want to get rid of the C but the A is not going to work I just know

777
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:40,140
and you'll go because the next note is a B D down to C do you see these things repeat like you know

778
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:47,160
it's actually kind of boring you know like it's not once you realize once you see it you're like oh yeah

779
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,560
you she did that already she moved a note along got rid of that one and then it turned out that

780
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,500
the following note meant that the three sequences of notes are scaled downwards so that no we did

781
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,540
that already you know and so that kind of thing just becomes instinct because there's no way you're

782
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:08,040
going to go through it in your head every time do you know it's like it just becomes boring and

783
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:20,520
you're like but it's nice to play it you know and again that one that's held for one two three needs

784
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:44,880
to have attitude you know okay there we have a long note just turn it into short notes I think 90% of

785
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,760
this melodic variation thing is just long note short notes as I call it that whole system of finding

786
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,080
your long notes turn them in short notes find your short notes and try and create long notes you know

787
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:01,500
that's a really good baseline kind of thing to do and I don't know the beauties of autumn the Gihan's

788
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:07,440
reel I'm not sure what that is either and but I can look them up why not it's kind of fun like you know

789
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,920
and you can kind of try and find little little patches like that in your own tunes that you're

790
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:22,320
working on at the moment and let's see what's Gihan's it's is it Tommy Gihan let's have a look

791
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:31,000
it's I have a feeling it's a GUI is it that's how we spell Gihan over here little little dope I'll put

792
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:40,960
in G-E-E-H-A-N and see what comes up oh I won't spend too long because we're nearly at the end

793
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,540
I can play the first few notes

794
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:46,060
sure

795
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:54,420
oh it's Eileen O'Callaghan's is it this one

796
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:59,000
yeah I have it here hang on till I see what it is

797
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:09,060
I don't

798
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:13,840
very close

799
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:23,860
oh yeah Michal plays that one

800
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:39,060
yeah I mean it's the same thing it's the same the same theory really I maybe I won't go into it

801
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:47,120
because I'm not that sure the tune it might be just a bit of a so let's have a look like if you

802
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:57,180
if you that's the first phrase you know do do do do do do do bump up but is that that's really you know

803
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:03,360
that's it's gonna be the same thing you get yes once you see me do a few of these you're like oh

804
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:12,420
yeah this is actually really boring and G sorry G I'm surprised I can get a whole workshop out of it

805
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:26,480
B G D G B A D G B A so we have a long note we're in the key G yeah you know you can figure out how to

806
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:32,240
three ways to find out what key you're in look at the last note of a eight bar thing works 90% of

807
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:39,240
the time but not all the time and try and record yourself playing the tune play it back and try and

808
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,220
play a G along with it or an A along with it and if it sounds right it's probably in that key of it

809
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:51,540
sounds wrong it's probably not and if your ear is terrible god help you and and but looking at the

810
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:57,180
notes in it like you know the C naturals and the key and you know that these are all like every

811
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:03,900
single note there except the A is in the corner of G G B and D they're all you know that's so we

812
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:16,320
know where the key of G now we G B G D G B A G B so let's do the move along trick again so we did G for

813
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:24,300
two so we make it last for three that G then this is a real typical example now we have another G we

814
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:31,500
can't hold it for four I mean we can but you need serious attitude for that so that's that's a real

815
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:37,860
typical example of moving the B along you know and and more than the other ones the other two examples

816
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,400
that we did and if you asked me what the other two examples were I wouldn't be able to tell you now

817
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:50,960
but I know we did that twice already G B D you know and and sorry B and then this stays the same the

818
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,140
whole way down you know you're kind of rooting yourself so that you know where to get back to

819
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:11,940
so because or I mean the other thing that I did the first step usually is a G G you know just to

820
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:17,700
divide it into its four but I play it like I that's part of my style is to play that like a double G up

821
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:24,540
nearly all the time and and then it's it's a funny one because it's not going back to the G here it's

822
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:33,780
here so you can't do a G F G I mean you could do what I would do there is base my my little short note

823
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:42,340
very variations on this a lot of the three G taking up three notes rather than two so now I can do G F G

824
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:48,040
and stick with the B and that's going to work going back into that so that's my that's what I would

825
01:11:48,040 --> 01:12:04,120
base that on so you've got do you know what I mean so whereas it would be hard to vary that too much

826
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:11,400
I needed to get this done first which is funny I didn't it it happened instinctively I didn't because

827
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:17,640
that's kind of nearly in other ones of other examples I would wait till down here before

828
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,440
showing you that but it's something in me knew that I had to do that in order to get any more

829
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:28,920
kind of variation so you can see how it kind of starts to you just kind of get a feel for it as

830
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:36,060
well definitely you know and start listening to to all those people and that you like whose music you

831
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,920
like and that you think you want to sound like you know and that's what I did if I you know I

832
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:47,280
spoon-feed my students I spoon-feed the hell out of them I'm like Jesus Christ nobody ever spoon-fed me

833
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:54,540
like this and but what I did was I for an hour or two every night I sat with me Hall O'Reilly's music

834
01:12:54,540 --> 01:13:01,260
because that's who I liked and I I there was no slow down or thing it was cassette and just write

835
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:06,420
down every little thing I could hear him doing and there's no substitute for that just to go in

836
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:13,620
the what are they doing and like I didn't really ask him but like if my students ask me what did

837
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:19,420
you do there I'm so happy and I will tell them but like most hardly any of my students do that you

838
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:26,280
have to there's a few where they're like really like fully like realize that that's it like that

839
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:32,460
you have to like really toothpick fine-tooth comb not a toothpick a fine-tooth comb and go through

840
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:43,020
it and GBBG let's see yeah it's okay I wouldn't do it instinctively definitely not incorrect might

841
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:49,680
work on other instruments better than mine yeah I you could put a little cut between it then if you're

842
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,960
going into the ornamentation territory yeah I kind of like it that's kind of one I wouldn't have

843
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:03,180
thought of so yeah um so yeah um any questions there that's probably I mean you get the idea yeah

844
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:09,560
is it did was it all stuff you know already or did that help at all

845
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:20,800
okay good good good I hope so but um it helps to break it all down yeah I mean it's it is that's

846
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,640
basically what it is when you actually kind of go for it feel free to unmute there if you want to say

847
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:34,180
anything but um it's kind of you know it's there's a bit of drudgery there for sure that you have to go

848
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:39,980
through but you can see that even in the future what did we do five tunes there's repetition already

849
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:48,460
in the in the thing that we did you know uh it's instinctive for me um but you have your kind of

850
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:56,580
patterns and your you know each person has their patterns and their things they do um for sure um

851
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:02,800
it wouldn't necessarily yeah Jim so basically what we're looking for is flexibility

852
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:12,420
and not uh pre-arranged arrangements that we learned that just play those arrangements in a

853
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:19,620
non-varied way well yeah a bit of both like as children we compete in the flas and the flas is

854
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:27,200
um you arrange your flat tune so I suppose you know if you think of it like a a person born here

855
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:32,260
playing this music you know I would have arranged all my flat tunes but you're also

856
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:37,860
in sessions kind of instinctively learning it but there's definitely no harm in arranging your tunes

857
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:44,320
um but also to put in this kind of I don't know even maybe the knowledge of this might help

858
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:51,800
rather but I find with my students that it's it's the skill to be able like you're trying like that

859
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:58,000
video game analogy these obstacles coming towards you is really quite a good one for how you want your

860
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,760
brain to be working you know that oh oh I'm not I'm not good you know it's not wrong it's not wrong to play

861
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:15,480
and you know actually I probably the first time around the tune would play it would play it like

862
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:31,020
that you know and then start to put slight variations in and you just get kind of an instinct for it but

863
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:37,220
you have the instinct isn't enough if you're not able to react I suppose and it is kind of it is kind

864
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:43,120
of like that so the training of reacting um I think is really important and for adult learners is what I'm

865
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:48,580
really looking at you know this is more applicable to adult learners than to children really who

866
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:57,180
absorb things like feckin you know sponges curses curses of god on them all um but yeah yeah a

867
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:01,520
combination Jim I would say anybody else any questions or anything to add

868
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:11,100
yes yeah so I know the whole idea I think a lot of this is to avoid for formulas and to um um avoid

869
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:21,820
boredom and um but um um not to get a formula but how in terms of the variations and also ornaments

870
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:29,240
in playing let's say one particular tune do you have a certain um general philosophy or

871
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:34,860
um about how how you build a tune you know like you said just said you start maybe the first time

872
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:40,720
through playing it the basic you know historic notes that you learned and then how do you build it

873
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:48,440
is it just a linear progression where you yeah I build it from I mean on my instrument um you have

874
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:54,960
you know I'd be inclined to put in simple harmony notes in within the same octave of the uh of the tune

875
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:02,840
before then putting you know uh lower octave bulkier things in I would be hanging on to chords or to

876
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:09,160
crans for a while I wouldn't be too I'd be keeping them for a little bit later in the tune and I think

877
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:14,640
that's not I'm not I wouldn't be too unique in that I think that would be quite common to let the tune

878
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:21,700
breathe and then let it be delicately kind of decorated and then uh you know go create go all out

879
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,880
you know the third time around or whatever or towards the end kind of thing that's what I

880
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:32,560
I I'm you know I'm t any of my kids that I'm teaching um with their flat tunes that's kind of

881
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,720
what I'm trying to get them to do like I try to not I hate the idea that at the flat now the tune has

882
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:45,740
been arranged for them so they learn it that way I want them to I want to give them you know 10 ways

883
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,860
of playing that 10 ways of playing that bit there that bit there that bit there now you have all these

884
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:55,220
ways of playing that you put it together you know and I think that's really um more useful but they

885
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:02,320
they they probably won't win because I'm not make making it into this scientific project that they

886
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,680
just know how to do this because like I hate the fact that kids now you know a lot of them just know

887
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:12,220
this amazing flat tune in F minor and but they can't play like the silver spear you know I just hate

888
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:18,480
it it's awful um so yeah I must teach them all the silver spear this week actually I'm always saying

889
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,260
that and I never teach it because it's kind of hard actually on concertina but um yeah so there's

890
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:29,740
there's loads uh loads but I think really before going too crazy with any of the um ornamentation

891
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:35,580
before going too crazy with ornamentation look at what you can do with just no technique whatsoever

892
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,480
it's amazing you don't need you don't need to be afraid of ornamentation and thinking of oh god it's

893
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,400
all these techniques I have to learn I can't do it do that first get your brain doing that first

894
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,020
that's going to make your brain better going to make it more able to do the ornamentation when

895
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:57,900
it comes up you know and then and then you've got the world is your oyster you know and really work

896
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:03,980
on one tune find your tune that you're playing find your little bits in it that are um that are

897
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:10,760
repetitive figure out a way to play them and play it different every eight bars or four bars or two bars

898
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:16,100
or one bar when you're on one bar you're able to do it you know that would be the the kind of way I

899
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:24,440
would uh approach it hi Kathy um yeah I would approach it that way so yeah uh anybody else

900
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:34,240
well okay um so so but the the I guess also a matter of taste so the final time around on a tune

901
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:39,020
you you wouldn't necessarily it wouldn't be linear that's probably by the time you get to the last

902
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:45,900
time around the basic melody is unrecognizable and no one knows where you started from no definitely

903
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:51,060
not like I'll play that I'll play the um superman jig as if I was playing it the second time around so

904
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,020
you know we're kind of

905
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:57,180
you know

906
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:02,340
you know

907
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:07,460
you know what I mean so you might

908
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:35,180
you know what I mean so you might go a little bit off piste but not crazy you

909
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,060
know so it's still recognized I'm you know people have different styles Tommy Potts is going to be

910
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:44,060
playing it and you're like what the hell is that Tony DeMarco you're like what's that Paul

911
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:48,600
McNevin what is what's that chin ah you're gonna know what tune I'm playing people are different

912
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,700
you know you're gonna know the tune you're gonna it's recognizable as that tune you know so yeah

913
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:59,220

Brenda there was one last thing I wanted to ask yeah and that is uh are there um regional traditions

933
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:30,160
with variation uh so would you be able to identify a player based on uh where he or she uh is located

934
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:36,080
or comes from or what with variation I don't know with variation with ornamentation for sure you know

935
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:42,340
that already probably but I don't know what variation I guess and probably it's it then you're

936
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:46,720
starting to go into the whole ornamentation or variation is a type of ornamentation thing you

937
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,060
know and then definitely yeah for sure for sure fiddle players it's mostly fiddle but the concertina

938
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:58,060
