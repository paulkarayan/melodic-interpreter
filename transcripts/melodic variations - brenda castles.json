{"text": " . Hi, everybody. How you doing? I guess you guys all. Oh, you're great. You can chat over and back. Great, great, great. Oh, great to see you all. How you doing? We can chat away while people are coming in. If you have anything to say, feel free. Hi, Ren. Hi, Scott. Hi, Brenda. Feel free to chat away until we get started. It's summer here. The clock just changed in Dublin, in Ireland. We just had our clock change. So we always say there's a grand stretch in the evening. So today's the first evening with a grand stretch in the evening. And I don't know. I'm assuming there's some Irish people, some American people, maybe. But for any of you not here anyway, it's amazing. You guys had the clock change in America a few weeks ago. I think there's always a little bit of a staggeredness. I missed some of my lessons this week because of it. You always have to keep an eye on it then a few weeks. Original sound is going on. Hang on. There it is. Okay. We have that sorted. I'm just going to check the waiting room. Okay. So I think somebody's letting them in. Caitlin's probably letting them in. So that's grand. I'll keep an eye anyway. So we'll get started and people can join. You know, I want to make the most of the time. If there's anyone that has anything specific that they want out of this workshop, throw it into the chat there. More than happy to kind of be specific with people's kind of wishes and things like that. I'm going to start. I'm not going to spend too much time on theory kind of things. I want to get into it practically. And kind of, I was kind of thinking maybe just of looking at actual like snippets of tunes and actually kind of figuring out how to do some melodic variation within those. So that's what I think would be the best. If that sounds good to you guys, that's what I was thinking of doing. Yeah. Yeah, good, good, good. Um, anyone got anything to say there? No? All good. Okay. So just a quick kind of a thing. I guess most of you probably know what melodic variation is, but like what, you know, what is it? I am for me. It's kind of a little bit. I mean, variation, ornamentation, melodic variation, tune versions, that kind of thing. You know, what is what? And there's all blurred. I think there's blurred lines. But for the purpose of this, isn't that what Miley Cyrus says? But for the, for the purpose of this workshop, I think that it's just admit somebody in there. Um, I think that, you know, ornamentation involves technique. I think with these melodic variations, there's actually no technique involved. Um, there's no special skill, um, to be able to do a melodic variation. It's just varying, um, the melody. And I, I have a kind of a, a little kind of a system of how to put in ornamentation. I almost view melodic variation as a kind of ornamentation. But ornamentation is also a kind of variation. So it's really like what, you know, what came first kind of thing. But I have a little kind of a ladder, an ornamentation ladder system that I, I try to implement sometimes for students. Um, when, when trying to get them to put ornamentation in and goes from your, your lowest rung is your easiest form of ornamentation. And, you know, which would be different depending on what you find easy compared to somebody else, you know, somebody else might find this thing easy. Somebody else might not know how to do this thing. So it's not part of their ladder or anything yet. But I, when I was starting off with that little system, it's just a simple little system that I have. Um, I kind of, um, thought that melodic variation or what I sometimes call it long notes, short notes, my own terminology. Nobody would, nobody else would know what you were talking about if you said that. But long notes, short notes is finding the long notes and making them into shorter notes or looking at short, a group of short notes and figuring out how to throw in a long note. That's really kind of what melodic variation is to me. Um, the, that's the basics of it. Um, I thought that that was going to be a real easy thing for people because there's not an actual skill, you know, you don't have to know how to do a cut. You don't know how to do, know how to do a crann. Um, do you know what I mean? It's just literally very, this melody, but actually people, my students, I discovered a lot of people find it quite hard. Um, and it is basically in my mind, it's maths debate. You know, the, the, the kind of this, the kind of, um, small, uh, on dramatic, you know, kind of little, nice, tasty, little variations. Not the, the big, crazy, like kind of almost like a jazz variation. That's gone, you know, the tune is kind of unrecognizable. But I think in Irish music, more of those little variations there, they're kind of like a little bit like maths. You know, it's, it's maths with, with feeling is what I always say about, uh, music. Um, so, um, that's kind of, that's what I would think. Has anyone any questions about that before we, uh, maybe get stuck into some tunes or anything to add to that? Oh, and did anyone put anything in chat? Nothing yet in chat, I don't think. And nobody waiting to get in. Okay, good. Um, I have one thing to say. Yeah. I guess for me, melodic variation is difficult because I've learned the tune with sort of muscle memory. And so, and, and, you know, I'm just getting to the point now where I'm kind of following, I'm playing the tune as I'm hearing it in my head. And I'm assuming that's kind of where the, the, uh, melodic variation starts to come in. Yeah. It's hard, isn't it? Like, you know, you're, you're, it's the, that's the thing. Um, are we, are we mostly concertina players or are there non-concertina players? Uh, any, a, a, a whistle there I see. Yeah. Um, I think it doesn't matter either way. Um, just with concertina especially, um, I feel like that kind of, I play it this way thing. You have to be very careful because, uh, of, of the, the variety of ways there are to play the bloody thing on that bloody instrument. Um, so that's the problem, a blessing and a curse. I always call it. You could, there's so many different ways to play it, but then when it comes to melodic variation, if you have been kind of keeping yourself adaptable with how you play it on the instrument, and then the melodic variation is probably easier. Um, so, uh, um, yeah, like it, I suppose it's that thing of getting stuck, but really, I suppose if I, if I look at this now, I, hopefully this will be helpful for that actually, Scott. So I'll have, uh, let's see if this is helpful with that just because it does, a lot of it, I find when I'm teaching it, I never learned it this way. And I'm teaching it kind of going, Oh, I would just do this kind of naturally, you know, like there's nearly no way I would ever play the same phrase twice in a tune in a row, unless it was on purpose. I nearly couldn't do it, you know, it's almost impossible. So what I get some of my students to do, like say for instance, now there will be some ornamentation in this, but I'm, I am trying to stick to melodic variation in this, but it's gonna overlap a touch. Well, let, we will try and really focus on that topic, but for instance, the tune, and you don't have to know these tunes, um, in order for it to, to, to, to, you know, to be, to understand it. But there's, you know, a tune called, um, the Glantin, um, and it's, it, you know, it's one of these reels that's an A, B, you play the first part once, the second part once. And, um, so the, and most of those, the first part at least is generally four bars repeated. So there's re they're really quite repetitive, you know, and this tune, like, you know, How's that sound by the way? Any problems? It's good. Okay. So that's the tune. It's basically that twice. Exact same thing twice. And what I find really helps with putting in melodic variation there is, find three different ways to play. Because that's the bit that's repeating, isn't it? D, G, B, G. You know, find a few different ways to play it. And then every time you come to it, play it different and go around in circles. I have my students do that for weeks and weeks. And go around in circles. And when you suddenly, suddenly you find yourself bored and it won't be for a while, that's when, you know, okay, I'm comfortable with this now. So it could be just a long D. So the first time, always let the tune exist, let the tune be. You need to know what the tune is before you vary it. That was it once. Now we have it again. A long D. And then we have it again. So it's three times in four bars. Do you know what I mean? That's what I mean about these repeating phrases. When you're going looking in, I mean, we've jumped in quite quickly here, but when, when you're going looking for a place, where do you, where do you put the melodic variation is a question, I suppose. This is where you find the bit that repeats the bit. That's like, oh God, am I like, you know, am I going to play this over and over again the same? No, this is the bit you want to vary. And you could just find that one part, one, there'll be one in most tunes, there'll be one obvious thing like that. And you go, okay, I'm going to go in there, look at that, how many ways can I play that? Outside the scope of this, this workshop, you'll be looking at all your ornamentation as well. In this workshop, like melodic variation in that is the long D. So D, the notes are D, G, B, G. Right. So now we're going to get rid of the G, the first G, D, G, B, G is going to become D, D, B, G. So it's maths, the D is now worth the D and the G. And actually, that's a good first step. You've got three times of this repeating phrase in four bars. So first, what you're trying to do is get your brain reacting to what's coming. It's like a video game. Here comes this boring bit again, you know, what am I going to do? It's like, oh God, let's do it, but your brain isn't maybe there yet, depending on what stage you're at. So what I get people to do is maybe for eight bars, maybe six times you do the melody. Or maybe you're going to three times, because you do it for four bars. I hope that makes sense. If anybody doesn't understand what I'm saying there, but yeah, it happens three times in four bars, one, two, three. That's your four bars, yeah? So the first three times, you just do the melody. The second, put in that long note. It's too quick to be changing yet. You're not comfortable with it yet. So do that three times. Okay, now let's figure out another way. Well, we have turn the second low D, the second beat of that long low D into a high D. And then, you know, when you get bored with that going round and round in circles and everything is like in the proper tempo. You're playing it with a metronome maybe and then, okay, let's see, can we do it every second thing? Do them twice in a row, which gives you kind of your going over, you're moving them along different four bar kind of sections, you know, you're kind of, and then until, once you're doing that melodic variation, every bar, then you're kind of doing it, you know, you're kind of going, and of course, there's more than three ways to do it. So you start bringing in other ways and you just don't ever go to the second part. Just play it. It's a great tune for that. I use this tune a lot. I probably thought it to you, Scott. And then you just go round and round in circles and start to be, just be able to react to the thing that's coming up to you because that's what it really is. You know, when you get used to it, that's really what it is, is kind of just, yeah, I'm just going to check the questions. And if anyone has any questions or suggestions about that. So to work on some variation when learning a tune, yeah, it is good to work on it when learning the tune. It's different schools of thought. I know that like Mary Bergen teaches the variations and the ornamentation while people are learning the tune. I don't, I really feel like, and who am I to disagree with Mary Bergen, but like it's a different instrument. But like for me, I'm kind of like, if you can't play the tune, basically, I don't see if you've any business putting any ornamentation or variations into it, you know? Maybe that's, maybe I should rethink it, maybe, maybe not ornamentation, but maybe variation is good to put into it while you're learning it. And that might make it just easier for you rather than it be like Scott said, like, you know, you're stuck in the way you're playing and not stuck, but you play it from muscle memory. And then putting this variation in is kind of, yeah, it's another way to think about it for sure. And that tune is called the Glantan. Hang on till I write it down. It's not the road to Glantan, it's just the Glantan, I believe. And, oh, funny spelling there, but yeah. So now, when I try varying a tune on the fly, sometimes diverge a little too much from the melody and lose myself, gag it back to the tune. Embarrassing. Yes. Absolutely. Happens us all. So, you know, I think that work that I've just suggested in the Glantan, that kind of thing is really valuable groundwork to put in at home so that you get used to being able to do these things on the fly. Doing them on the fly, like it's kind of, it's kind of hard. It's kind of a, you know, a bit of, it's kind of advanced moves, you know, especially if you're in a session and you're maybe going a bit faster or not quite the swingy rhythm you like to play at, then things are just harder, you know, and you could maybe practice your, I think keep it, keep it to less things, you know, do one thing per tune first. I mean, that's, you know, set realistic goals, life lessons here on Tune Supply. Set realistic goals, you know, do one thing in several tunes, do one thing in one tune, then do one thing in several tunes, then do one thing in each part. Do you know what I mean? And it's just building it up like that gives you, gives you a, a more, more chance of success and you'll be delighted with yourself, you know? So yeah, so getting yourself back to the tune, I, oh, the other thing that I've been doing, it happens with that, with that comment from Karen, and you know, when you lose it and you can't get back, I find, especially with concertina, but I think this applies to most instruments, that when people start getting out of control, they start playing harder and pumping harder and, and, you know, becoming more tense, and on whatever instrument it is, fingers and bows and whatever become more tense. And I do think that I've tried to train myself on, I play really bad guitar and I've tried to kind of train myself to respond by quietening down and, you know, softening rather than harder. It makes it sound so much worse when you go like, and scraping like, oh, I'm lost and I'm making sure everybody hears it, you know? So trying to just kind of react that way is really good, you know? Could we create a list of types of variations from simple to more complex? Well, you see, Richard, what you're talking about is ornamentation there. So I'm not going to go to, like, octaves are ornamentation in my mind, you know? They are obviously a variation because the word vary, you know? But here I'm looking at melodic variations. So I am going to go through to some tunes now because we've spent maybe 15 minutes there. So we've an hour or so left to look at actual tunes. I am happy to take tune suggestions, but I'm going to start with a few of my own ideas. Because, you know what, I used to play tunes, there's tunes that, you know, you've been playing this music since you were five, you develop different relationships with tunes. Like there's tunes that I used to hate, that I love now. And you just kind of realize, oh, and some of them are tunes that are just so repetitive. But now when I see a repetitive tune, I'm like, oh, this is a tune that I can put loads of ornamentation, it's like wide open for all of it. The battering ram. Okay, we'll have a look at the battering ram in a while. So it leaves it wide open. One of the most repetitive tunes that I know, and the most boring ones, is the, we call it the Superman jig, but Bill Hart's jig, because it's, it sounds like Superman. You know? But it's, that's Bill Hart's jig, or affectionately known as the Superman jig. I do have a blackboard behind me here, and I don't have an S on my computer keyboard actually, so I'm going to use a Z, oh dear. I have four computers though, this is just the one, all the other ones have an S. So, so Bill Hart's, just looking at that, like, you know, if you take the melody, I tried, GoFundMe to buy you an S, I tried to get an S, there is no way to get an S on this. I copy and paste my S's. So, if we wrote down, I mean, now we're getting to the point, okay, what is the actual melody? Is it like the, oh, I, I, I, for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to say that the melody is all those long notes. You know, so there's loads of long notes there, but it, it's not really a huge jump. I mean, maybe I won't go into this one too much, it's too simple. So, you know, it's not a huge jump to be going. So, I got rid of every single long note there. None of it was, and there was absolutely no skill involved. Zero. All I did was the maths. Now, if any, I mean, that, it's pretty simple there, but I, I won't go through it all. But just so that you have it, I mean, you know, I, I think you, you probably get that. But just because it is a workshop, God, how am I going to, how am I going to do this? This is going to be fun. Um, maybe I should have moved that chair. Okay. Now, I wonder, can you see that blackboard? I think you can. Yeah. Maybe I'm going to bring this closer. Okay. So, and I will, I'll bring it even closer actually. And, so the, if we go D and I, and so we're in groups of three because it's a jig. D, D, A, A. So I'll just deal with like literally little phrases like that. D, D, A, A. This is word two. These are word three. This is two, three. You know, so it just becomes D, E, D, A, G, A, B. And the same the whole way through. So that's the absolute basics of it. You know, I think you can all probably do that. And D, D, A, D, I mean, then it's kind of like, well, what else could you do? You know, that's a melodic variation. You know, you could do, you know, you could do chords and you can do octaves and you can do, but they're not melodic variation as I see it. So for D, so. I would do a low A instead of the E there. That's another variation. D, A, D. And there's where your music theory comes in a little bit. You could, it's good to have a little mild bit of music theory for this. So, you know, we're in the key of D something or other. And just to know that the notes, the chords in the key and the notes in the chords. So just a quick, I know most people know that, but the chords in the key. Now this is kind of D mixolydian. So it doesn't really follow that. But in D major, D minor, it's D, it's one, four and five, D, G and A. If anyone doesn't understand that, that's fine. And this is going to be D's and C's because it's what's called mixolydian. It goes from the D to the C to the, isn't it? Or it's modal or something. Anyway, it doesn't matter too much. But if we, the main thing is the chord of D is one, three and five, D, F and A. And so D and A, you know, this is basically a D sound. This long D, D is a long sound of D. And so the low A is going to work because that's part, that note is part of the chord. And so that's low D, E, D, D, A, D, probably D, C, D is going to work. It's going to not, a note above the main note and a note below, usually are options. So we have D, E, D, D, C, D. I don't like it as much, but there's no denying it works, you know? So now we have like one, two, three and D, C, D, four melodic ways of playing it. And none of them are rocket science, you know? But it's just a case of getting your brain to start thinking like that. That's all it is, you know? So now if I, now if I go through the whole tune with this phrase. You know what I mean? Immediately, immediately it sounds more interesting to the ear. And it's not, we've done nothing. We've done next to nothing, you know? And all the rest of the notes I kept the same. So really don't, I suppose one message here is don't get bogged down in technique. It's so, it's so, there's such little things that can make. And then if we do the same to this one. So we have AGA. I actually, I really, like this topic I find really interesting, you know? But like, so AGA, I wonder what an A, I think this one's going to be harder. I don't think an A, so we said the note below and the note above the main note. So if the main note here was D, E is above it and C is below it. Here we have A, G is below it and we know that works. But will B work? It works, but it's kind of iffy because there's a B coming soon after it melodically. So we have D, you'd want to be very sure of which note is the note that has the beat, you know? So that kind of thing. A is a note in the chord of D, D, F and A, we said one, three and five. So I'm figuring that a low D might work here. So A, B, A, yeah, sure. And A, D, A is going to work. Because that, and it's, again, they're all going to work with varying levels of, you know, taste is a factor. You might not like it as much. You kind of start to, a lot of melodic variation, you get a feel for what works and what doesn't work. So now, now we have a scenario where we have four ways to play this and four ways to play this without ever touching ornamentation yet. We haven't brought in crayons or rolls or cuts or, do you know what, or harmony notes. So now we get to mix and match. So we're really in a good position here. We go. And so we do mix and match. We do this one with this one and this one with this one. And, you know, that's really increases the number of ways you can play it. And it's kind of like, holy moly. Like, do you actually need to do anything else at that point? You know, it's just so much going on then. And for your brain, like I was struggling there a little bit, like just playing that through, going, oh God, which one am I going to do with that one next? You know, and you know, there's, there's a lot going on there. So, um, I, I, I look like that's, but you're, I will get a little bit more complicated than this as well. But, uh, just kind of, it's a good introduction to kind of what actually can be done with so little, um, of anything. So does anyone have any questions about that? Um, I can move on to maybe the second part of the tune as well. Um, but is that clear? And is there any, if there's any part of that, like, like you were complete, like on, what is she talking about? Please don't hesitate to ask, you know? Brenda, um, I was wondering if, um, uh, after some practice, it ever comes easier to you because right now looking at this, it seems like you have to very intense, intently think about, you know, what are the options. And so almost you sort of map out, like, these are the different options. And this is, then I think about where to put them in. No, it becomes natural. I mean, you know, you guys, I presuming most of you are adult learners, um, you know, this immersion, I never had to think about it, you know, ever. I only think about it when I'm teaching. Um, I think about it in a, in a, like, uh, this is the whole thing I think about when I'm playing traditional Irish music. If I'm in a session, this is all I'm thinking about. That's what, this is what it's all about. Like, to me, this is where, once you get beyond the, once you get to a certain point of being able to play okay, this is it, to me. You know, this is what you're in the session. You're hearing the person beside you go. Like, for instance, Sean Clawsey, a good friend of mine in Boston. Like, there's a tune called The Boys of the Town. And Sean is the best crack for playing a session. And he's just, he's got such lift in his music. And once, and you're sitting beside him and you're like, and he, he did this thing. And he did, so the tune is. And he did, this is where you're going into the big jazzy, but it's not crazy, but I would never think of it. And he just did. So yeah, your ending point, you're landing on that low G. And now I, I never play that tune without doing that, you know, but nobody else I've ever heard doing it, you know, or the likes of playing with Michelle. So this is, this is what I'm sitting in a session, listening to the other person. And what, on the other instruments, it's not going to constantly play fiddle. And, and you're kind of like picking up, you know, that's the freedom of it and the fun. And maybe to have a few drinks and it's even better. And, you know, but the, another one is Michelle O'Brien. I played with her a lot and I, she plays old John's jig. And so the very, the, she puts in a great one again, a big, another big one kind of thing. And here she, she, instead of that, she does. Now, you could say that's three cramps, but you could do that without cramps. You could do, you know, and that, so now you've got, you know, it's so different, but you're, you're at your landing point. What I always say when you're doing any ornamentation, but variation as well. It's Cotton Eye Joe. Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where are you going? Where have you come from? Where is that last note before this variation is happening? Root yourself in that. Figure out your variation on its own. And then where are you going? What's the next note out of that variation? Out of the changed thing. This is ornamentation or variation. This will work. Make sure that you're able and this will help with, oh, I'm in the session and I do a big variation. I get lost and I can't find my way back. That rooting yourself. I'm not finished answering your question, Lulu. I just got waylaid. But yeah, so all of that is interesting, but the answer to your question, the fuller answer or the end of the answer to your question, Lulu, is I think that all of that work is really important to do because then, especially as adult learners, I think that then it starts to bring it in naturally. I'm working with students at the moment with adults. I teach a lot of adult students and I'm working with quite a few of them on trying to get into that natural way of being able to do ornamentation and variations. And these exercises, you won't always have to do that. You know, this music of ours is not that complicated. Like, you know, we're not playing crazy keys. We're in D, G and A and E minor and A minor. You know what I mean? So it crosses over. We're playing mostly jigs and reels. So it crosses over, but it's definitely worth putting that work in for a while. And the reward then is you see it start to cross over and it starts to become easier. But it can be a bit boring and it can be hard if you don't know how or where to go, like how to go about it, I suppose, on your own. So, um, so yeah, um, that answered that question. Yeah. Anybody else? Um, okay. I might look at the second part of this real quick. Um, or yeah, then move on to a real, um, or the battering ram. We could look at two. Let's see. So, um, the blackboard isn't very big. So there's not room for many phrases, but, um, it's kind of cool to do just, uh, so the second part, so the second part of that tune is so boring. Oh God, because it's just such a dose of, it's basically, it's basically some long notes and all that stuff that we're bored of already from the first part. Do you know what I mean? Cause, cause it's. Here's the second part. And again. And again. It's two bars. It's awful. You know? So you have, like, oh my God. You really have to vary it. Um, and I'm going to take off my jumper cause it's warm here. Um, so that second part is actually even more interesting. So you've got, I'm going to write it. I'm going to write it smaller. So you have D and if you can't see it, um, I think Caitlin gives me your emails after or whatever. C, A, B, A, G, A, B, C. So it's C natural. So long, short, long, short, da, da, da, da, da, da. Okay. And it does that four times basically. You know? The long, short, long, short happen four times. So actually what I can do is make it bigger. Because what we'll be looking at is the D, B, C, A. That's the repeating bit. So find your, if you're looking for a system, a logical system, which is how my brain works, find a, find the repeating bit. And this is it. D, B, C, A. Now, obviously we've got, we can fill in this. D to B, there's an obvious note in between. Have a think what it is. Of course, it's going to be C. D, C, B. C to A, the note that lies in between is B. C, B, A. Okay. So now you have kind of, because then you can mix and match these two, you know? And, and that way, and that way, and that way, and that way, you know? So that all already opens it up. Can you see properly? Yeah? Okay. So now let me get the concertina because you can do so much by looking at it. That's melodic variation. You know? That's just melody. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. C. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D\u043b\u0435\u043das and D. D. Tina but let's have a little look oh yeah the obvious one is on some instruments you can double up D D B C C A so just two high D's see see again could be instrument specific maybe I you know I don't see why not you can go to the D the whole time that's still no skill there's no technique there that's still just melodic variation you know and again some instruments I can't imagine a fiddle would do it but you know definitely D D no D no D C no D no D so these are all you know easy very obvious variations instrument specific variations to you know oh that's a bit of a weird one but it's it could work on many instruments and let me just play it through and see if any other ones come yeah I mean you can hang on you can hang on to a note so say you made the C I got rid of the A and hold the C for three so now you could do D B D D B D B I'll play it in a minute and then C for the whole lot needs you have to have attitude to do that you can't just play a little kind of beige C you have to play it and mean it you know if you're gonna hang on to notes you need to mean it so now this becomes swell your notes you know kind of leave it hanging so I'll put it in it I'll play the tune a bit and put it in later into the tune so I'll play them all you know conversely you can do it with the high D and it's literally just it's actually simpler it's getting rid of notes you know but I would never do a D C you'd have to pair them up with with three notes and the other one you know so yeah so does that make make sense there we we still are on melodic variation we haven't gone to ornamentation at all and there's quite a lot there I think you'll agree right and it's again it's not rocket science it's just trying to get your brain thinking that way and so and any questions there or will I move on maybe to a real but the B part of it's not useful in this I mean do you know what I mean that's the repeat so there I went and find the repeating part so in the four bars of it it doesn't have a repeating thing and so everything repeats the second time around that four part four bars so the only thing really it's not quite a useful learning or teaching exercise for in that so it's B D D C sharp D so divide it into groups of four it's B D D C sharp D E F that's the two groups of four and so then it's just like oh just change the C sharp to an E or change it to a B and a low low G on concertina some of these things work and they might not work on other things so that's the kind of em this it's me again it's not quite a useful one so I'll I'll move on any other suggestions or questions yeah could you play that the bill hearts jig through yeah of course yeah completely and then that helps me a lot to be able to hear it back and yeah I'll play it and I'll play it through and try and stick to melodic variations as opposed to as opposed to ornamentation so I'm gonna play it I'll play the first part straight and I'm gonna get to the second part I'll play the second part straight as well I'm gonna play it well Thank you. This old long notes, short notes, like, you know, in this tune, we're looking at long notes and we're most, like, we started out with a long D and everything else really is making that, those long notes into short notes, apart from these attitude ones at the end where we're creating an even long note. When you get short notes and you turn them into long notes, then that opens up space, in concertina anyway, and I think in other instruments, it opens up space for things like harmony notes, for crans, for rolls, for triplets that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do. And that's another step along then, you know, you've created that space for another kind of ornamentation. So you can see where the, it kind of gets a bit blurred as to what, what is ornamentation and what is variation. So yeah, so anybody else move on? Yeah, I'll go on to a reel because it's, jigs are, I think, sometimes less fun. Um, what, is there anything else that I was going to say? Yeah, if you want to look at, like, so crazy variation, if you want, um, a YouTube, have you a question, Jim? Or is your hand just up accidentally? Exactly. Um, so, uh, if, if, uh, you want to look at, uh, variations, Tommy Potts, Ronan Brown has a series of Tommy Potts, uh, videos on YouTube. Um, one of them is My Love Is In America, and there's all of them, they're all, like, that kind of variation is insane. Like, you know, there's, like, he makes major tunes into minor keys, and he changes the, the time signature of things, you know? But it is very interesting to listen to, and you can, like, to me, this is where the creativity in the music is. And, with, if you look at videos like that, um, and hear, listen to the playing of Tommy Potts, the fireman, the fireman fiddler, um, you will really hear, like, somebody's creativity really in full flow, you know? It's absolutely insane. Um, but it's kind of, like, he's amazing, so he can do that. But it's, like, oh my god, what, you know? And I think another, I think Aidan Connolly, the fiddle player, is, uh, very interesting for variations like that as well. Where you're kind of like, oh my god, you know? But the, the important thing then is to be able to root yourself, in all of this, to be able to root yourself back in the tune and find the tune again. Um, and so, it's funny that, that, uh, I, I think, I can't remember who it was, I said it at the start. Um, oh, my touch screen isn't working. Um, oh, Karen, I think it was, yeah. Um, that it does kind of, um, it does kind of help to really root yourself in the tune, and that knowledge of the tune is so important. Um, let's look at, um, like, you know, let's just have a quick interlude, before we go back to simpler variations, of a couple of crazy ones. Like, you know, like, um, that tune. Um, no idea what it's called. Um, but like, there's something Michal always did in that, like, that, and I, I do, it, it suits a couple of tunes. Like, I don't know, I can't figure out what they are, but when you get to that point, it's like what you were saying, Lulu. When you get to that point in that tune, you're like, oh, that, that will work here. So, basically, it's kind of funny when he goes. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. you know it's a real mad kind of you know you know so you're really changing up the maths the whole you're not just changing you're changing the melody for quite some time and then getting back to it it's you know this is what I think that these little steps that you do really set you up to be able to go in and do more and more and of course listening to the person you want to sound like is a good thing you know the part and what what variations they do and that that's going to be really helpful but that again in situ all right so I need to play the tune twice I need to play the first part twice you know it's kind of crazy it's a crazy little air I love it though and when you're in a session it's a really nice a nice little variety thing and so and things I think reels I mean I have historically worked on and you know the Sally Gardens and the has anyone been to any of these you know the Sally Gardens the Star of Munster are really interesting tunes to work on but people might have done those with me before I'm not sure if has anyone done those with me before oh there's a new message let's see the scar to Glen let me look and see what it's like dude dude scared to Glen oh that's what it is oh yeah thank you didn't even know the name of it when it was shown to me and okay so and another one then it's even kind of just fun to pick a tune and just see what happens rather than have it like swinging on a gate could be a good one and let's have a look and see oh yeah there is kind of fun things that you know swinging on it most people seem to know swinging on a gate right so like it's I think it's kind of a nice chamber so we've two of those and then we have so we've three C a B G's one two three do you know what I mean so that's first step to identify the repeating the repeating boring bit I mean here that that I think it's quite charming that that repeated C a B G especially the two at the end that happen close together it's kind of nice confusing for students though and hmm sometimes there's in a chin like for me that's quite a huge feature of this tune that little for that phrase of notes isn't it I'm not gonna go crazy varying that like to the extent that I did with the other one with the C a B G though I would definitely vary that so right there and C a B G and you don't need you don't need many ways you know you just need a few ways so that you're not doing it over and over again the same way so C a B G it's four short notes first step let's make a long note you heard me doing it already C B G okay now that's more interesting that opens it up in concertina for some for some harmony notes so now maths one two three four we're in real time so now we have the C taking up the A spot the A is gone C B G and I'll remember whatever happened before it's staying the same and whatever after it's A G E G is staying the same you know it's a B most of the time coming before it it could be different no it's always a it's a B until the end and then it's a G coming before it so and now we've C B G okay let's see what hat what's another way because now I can play play different twice there in the end I'm actually hearing a longer C now so this is a a little bit more of an advanced move so you have you want to keep things the same but we want to make this C into three so it wants to take up the the B as well so now one two three will this work will a G work going into the A because it's an A G E G after it and so I'll play it the normal way first or the G doesn't sound good to me there what often happens I find is that when you take up the second spot you move it along and you you kind of that becomes there then and so if I if I put that B in and get rid of that G all together that because C to A is a kind of a natural fall in the scale C B A are our natural descending things so so now I have instead of the G doesn't sound as good that second option there the B sounds much better so now I can play that like it's actually more interesting to play the second to like the second four bars of it so you know and you can just play it different every time and that's that's you can play them in different spots I don't know if there's anything note substitution get rid of that a and replace it with a D that's gonna work and you kind of sometimes I get my students to suggest a note and you you might suggest it based on logic and theory and then you go to players there's only one way to find out if it works it's going to play it you know so C D B G definitely works and on here it is and I think a G will work I think it would sound nice because we're in the key of G and I think a return to a G both times will work so not only one way to find out I think you'll agree that sounds pretty good you know and I wonder is there any other note there's another variation that yeah like so CG worked because we're in the key of G so G I G is gonna kind of work my G's are funny I've been told over and over and so I mean you could also do C D back to your C B kind of almost taken from this one from the big long C the beginning and ending the same but the inner notes just a bit different so let's see what that sounds like so that works too but it's just not the tune but you could get you can do that once you know and that's fine you don't want to do it every time you don't want to get stuck oh this is how I play it now you know that's all of them played they're just in the second four bars of that eight bar because you but you have the other one as well so that you know that's quite again no skill involved the only skill and is is you know trying to figure out I'm playing around with it you know it's that does that make sense is that of any interest or of any use to you it's all small things looking at the key is good for that one there you know the C G B G and that one is good for you know you kind of go okay what why would you go back to a G that definitely works and it I know you said I'm a battering around but is anyone another real and maybe just for the crack maybe you know it's because that's what it's real life is like oh here's a real what how do we you know rather than me having something prepared this is a little bit more interesting and I hear you say the Eaton Derry say again the Eaton Derry or oh so many yeah a lot of has a lot of um repetition in it as I recall yeah totally does so the Eaton Derry is you know that's the first part I'm kind of going with a lot of first parts here but that B A G and Eaton Derry I'll put some of those names up that Eaton Derry is a weird little town in Westmeath that I I don't know if I've ever been to it and it's only up the road and so the Eaton Derry it's the tune the repeating bit like I said just said if that's the bit you find B A G B G G B A G B A G B A G happens three times it's similar to all of these it happens three times in four bars so six times in the first part alone you need a way to play it differently you know and so B A G B G G first thing I do with concertina is play the B twice take up the second space with another B just yeah it's it's I don't know if it works on all instruments you know so that's a nice easy way to break it up into its four and get the math sorted out B B A G won't work for all instruments I don't think um and then it's kind of like you know okay well we're turning a long note into short notes so now let's you look at the note substitution so I mean that's another thing I didn't talk about the other time if you let's look at these two B's you can sub out both of them actually the most easy and instinctive one to sub out is the second one so a high D like we're in the key of G now the the notes in the chord of G are G B and D one three and five so B is the third in the in the in the key of G so G B and D so I'm gonna say that a G or a B a G or a D is also going to work here so let's write them both down and let's hear how they sound so B D and everything stays the same after so you don't even have to think about that and then B G a G okay so they all work you know and low D might work B D a G maybe not as as well that one could be like weird wouldn't work in all instruments yeah not as much uh now it's got the other option is to substitute the first one and the way that works is there's only one way to do that you pick the note and it's probably like a slide in a whistle or a or a fiddle maybe that you're sliding up to the note you pick the note below the main note so here we have a B we're gonna pick the A and the second note is you landing on the main note so A B and the second ones the other notes stay the same so now you have I'll play them true so so I'll just play the normal and the last one just for now and you can hear it's got a different feel it's kind of like a slide up to it like a whistle or a fiddle would do so anytime you have a long note divided into into its two beats you can survive usually the second note has a ton of options related to the chord of the of the key we're in and then the first one you can always do a little slide up to it and the note below but no other note really will work there in that first position so that's kind of an interesting one and and let me see if there's any other way so I play I play the tune just so you can you know and that's all in one spot in the tune you can do the same to other spots you know and then suddenly you've got far more and again not a single bit of ornamentation there or just melodic variation so you know and I know that people are into ornamentation and a plug and I promise you that my ornamentation website that I've been talking about for oh maybe a feckin decade at this point is actually nearly ready to go live and at the moment it's concertina but there'll be other instruments on it too and it'll just be all about approaching ornamentation and how to get ornamentation including melodic variation and into your music and how to just a kind of a guide that will bring you through repetition and you know it can be boring and then there's moments of excitement when you get it and you get used to it and so that's it's called the ornamentation hive I'm hoping to get it online April May and so um but that's the Eden Derry and somebody said Gehen's or the Bear Island the Bear Island you know it's the same principles you're just trying to you've got a Bear Island is a fussy tune you know it's it's not got repeating and phrases in that first part it's all different it's a great tune and but you're looking for a place and it's all short notes so find a long note you know DBC a becomes D C a becomes D D C do you know what I mean you've moved it along we did that already and before that we we didn't so I'll just write it out quickly why not and just and again you know you don't need to know any of these tunes the bit we're looking at is D B C a B D D and so on D that's a C sharp get rid of the B D C A and then D we want to get rid of the C but the A is not going to work I just know and you'll go because the next note is a B D down to C do you see these things repeat like you know it's actually kind of boring you know like it's not once you realize once you see it you're like oh yeah you she did that already she moved a note along got rid of that one and then it turned out that the following note meant that the three sequences of notes are scaled downwards so that no we did that already you know and so that kind of thing just becomes instinct because there's no way you're going to go through it in your head every time do you know it's like it just becomes boring and you're like but it's nice to play it you know and again that one that's held for one two three needs to have attitude you know okay there we have a long note just turn it into short notes I think 90% of this melodic variation thing is just long note short notes as I call it that whole system of finding your long notes turn them in short notes find your short notes and try and create long notes you know that's a really good baseline kind of thing to do and I don't know the beauties of autumn the Gihan's reel I'm not sure what that is either and but I can look them up why not it's kind of fun like you know and you can kind of try and find little little patches like that in your own tunes that you're working on at the moment and let's see what's Gihan's it's is it Tommy Gihan let's have a look it's I have a feeling it's a GUI is it that's how we spell Gihan over here little little dope I'll put in G-E-E-H-A-N and see what comes up oh I won't spend too long because we're nearly at the end I can play the first few notes sure oh it's Eileen O'Callaghan's is it this one yeah I have it here hang on till I see what it is I don't very close oh yeah Michal plays that one yeah I mean it's the same thing it's the same the same theory really I maybe I won't go into it because I'm not that sure the tune it might be just a bit of a so let's have a look like if you if you that's the first phrase you know do do do do do do do bump up but is that that's really you know that's it's gonna be the same thing you get yes once you see me do a few of these you're like oh yeah this is actually really boring and G sorry G I'm surprised I can get a whole workshop out of it B G D G B A D G B A so we have a long note we're in the key G yeah you know you can figure out how to three ways to find out what key you're in look at the last note of a eight bar thing works 90% of the time but not all the time and try and record yourself playing the tune play it back and try and play a G along with it or an A along with it and if it sounds right it's probably in that key of it sounds wrong it's probably not and if your ear is terrible god help you and and but looking at the notes in it like you know the C naturals and the key and you know that these are all like every single note there except the A is in the corner of G G B and D they're all you know that's so we know where the key of G now we G B G D G B A G B so let's do the move along trick again so we did G for two so we make it last for three that G then this is a real typical example now we have another G we can't hold it for four I mean we can but you need serious attitude for that so that's that's a real typical example of moving the B along you know and and more than the other ones the other two examples that we did and if you asked me what the other two examples were I wouldn't be able to tell you now but I know we did that twice already G B D you know and and sorry B and then this stays the same the whole way down you know you're kind of rooting yourself so that you know where to get back to so because or I mean the other thing that I did the first step usually is a G G you know just to divide it into its four but I play it like I that's part of my style is to play that like a double G up nearly all the time and and then it's it's a funny one because it's not going back to the G here it's here so you can't do a G F G I mean you could do what I would do there is base my my little short note very variations on this a lot of the three G taking up three notes rather than two so now I can do G F G and stick with the B and that's going to work going back into that so that's my that's what I would base that on so you've got do you know what I mean so whereas it would be hard to vary that too much I needed to get this done first which is funny I didn't it it happened instinctively I didn't because that's kind of nearly in other ones of other examples I would wait till down here before showing you that but it's something in me knew that I had to do that in order to get any more kind of variation so you can see how it kind of starts to you just kind of get a feel for it as well definitely you know and start listening to to all those people and that you like whose music you like and that you think you want to sound like you know and that's what I did if I you know I spoon-feed my students I spoon-feed the hell out of them I'm like Jesus Christ nobody ever spoon-fed me like this and but what I did was I for an hour or two every night I sat with me Hall O'Reilly's music because that's who I liked and I I there was no slow down or thing it was cassette and just write down every little thing I could hear him doing and there's no substitute for that just to go in the what are they doing and like I didn't really ask him but like if my students ask me what did you do there I'm so happy and I will tell them but like most hardly any of my students do that you have to there's a few where they're like really like fully like realize that that's it like that you have to like really toothpick fine-tooth comb not a toothpick a fine-tooth comb and go through it and GBBG let's see yeah it's okay I wouldn't do it instinctively definitely not incorrect might work on other instruments better than mine yeah I you could put a little cut between it then if you're going into the ornamentation territory yeah I kind of like it that's kind of one I wouldn't have thought of so yeah um so yeah um any questions there that's probably I mean you get the idea yeah is it did was it all stuff you know already or did that help at all okay good good good I hope so but um it helps to break it all down yeah I mean it's it is that's basically what it is when you actually kind of go for it feel free to unmute there if you want to say anything but um it's kind of you know it's there's a bit of drudgery there for sure that you have to go through but you can see that even in the future what did we do five tunes there's repetition already in the in the thing that we did you know uh it's instinctive for me um but you have your kind of patterns and your you know each person has their patterns and their things they do um for sure um it wouldn't necessarily yeah Jim so basically what we're looking for is flexibility and not uh pre-arranged arrangements that we learned that just play those arrangements in a non-varied way well yeah a bit of both like as children we compete in the flas and the flas is um you arrange your flat tune so I suppose you know if you think of it like a a person born here playing this music you know I would have arranged all my flat tunes but you're also in sessions kind of instinctively learning it but there's definitely no harm in arranging your tunes um but also to put in this kind of I don't know even maybe the knowledge of this might help rather but I find with my students that it's it's the skill to be able like you're trying like that video game analogy these obstacles coming towards you is really quite a good one for how you want your brain to be working you know that oh oh I'm not I'm not good you know it's not wrong it's not wrong to play and you know actually I probably the first time around the tune would play it would play it like that you know and then start to put slight variations in and you just get kind of an instinct for it but you have the instinct isn't enough if you're not able to react I suppose and it is kind of it is kind of like that so the training of reacting um I think is really important and for adult learners is what I'm really looking at you know this is more applicable to adult learners than to children really who absorb things like feckin you know sponges curses curses of god on them all um but yeah yeah a combination Jim I would say anybody else any questions or anything to add yes yeah so I know the whole idea I think a lot of this is to avoid for formulas and to um um avoid boredom and um but um um not to get a formula but how in terms of the variations and also ornaments in playing let's say one particular tune do you have a certain um general philosophy or um about how how you build a tune you know like you said just said you start maybe the first time through playing it the basic you know historic notes that you learned and then how do you build it is it just a linear progression where you yeah I build it from I mean on my instrument um you have you know I'd be inclined to put in simple harmony notes in within the same octave of the uh of the tune before then putting you know uh lower octave bulkier things in I would be hanging on to chords or to crans for a while I wouldn't be too I'd be keeping them for a little bit later in the tune and I think that's not I'm not I wouldn't be too unique in that I think that would be quite common to let the tune breathe and then let it be delicately kind of decorated and then uh you know go create go all out you know the third time around or whatever or towards the end kind of thing that's what I I I'm you know I'm t any of my kids that I'm teaching um with their flat tunes that's kind of what I'm trying to get them to do like I try to not I hate the idea that at the flat now the tune has been arranged for them so they learn it that way I want them to I want to give them you know 10 ways of playing that 10 ways of playing that bit there that bit there that bit there now you have all these ways of playing that you put it together you know and I think that's really um more useful but they they they probably won't win because I'm not make making it into this scientific project that they just know how to do this because like I hate the fact that kids now you know a lot of them just know this amazing flat tune in F minor and but they can't play like the silver spear you know I just hate it it's awful um so yeah I must teach them all the silver spear this week actually I'm always saying that and I never teach it because it's kind of hard actually on concertina but um yeah so there's there's loads uh loads but I think really before going too crazy with any of the um ornamentation before going too crazy with ornamentation look at what you can do with just no technique whatsoever it's amazing you don't need you don't need to be afraid of ornamentation and thinking of oh god it's all these techniques I have to learn I can't do it do that first get your brain doing that first that's going to make your brain better going to make it more able to do the ornamentation when it comes up you know and then and then you've got the world is your oyster you know and really work on one tune find your tune that you're playing find your little bits in it that are um that are repetitive figure out a way to play them and play it different every eight bars or four bars or two bars or one bar when you're on one bar you're able to do it you know that would be the the kind of way I would uh approach it hi Kathy um yeah I would approach it that way so yeah uh anybody else well okay um so so but the the I guess also a matter of taste so the final time around on a tune you you wouldn't necessarily it wouldn't be linear that's probably by the time you get to the last time around the basic melody is unrecognizable and no one knows where you started from no definitely not like I'll play that I'll play the um superman jig as if I was playing it the second time around so you know we're kind of you know you know you know what I mean so you might you know what I mean so you might go a little bit off piste but not crazy you know so it's still recognized I'm you know people have different styles Tommy Potts is going to be playing it and you're like what the hell is that Tony DeMarco you're like what's that Paul McNevin what is what's that chin ah you're gonna know what tune I'm playing people are different you know you're gonna know the tune you're gonna it's recognizable as that tune you know so yeah can't say those names outside what happens in tune supply stays in tune supply but those guys are great like that they're they've got jazz heads on them I you know that we the rest of us can't keep up with them is basically what's happening you're like what what is that and they're you know flying around the place so yeah I suppose we can wrap it up there it's Sunday night I should probably relax um and uh enjoy the rest of your Sundays and I believe that Caitlin if um I'll put my email address up there sure why not and if any of you want to be on my concertina mailing list or on my ornamentation hive uh mailing list sure you can drop me a line on this oh it oh I've got no um I've got no s hang on I know I just have to do the copy pasting again I know that the tune supply password is copied and pasted there's copy okay now I can do it so the can you take a look at my cat you should have me on your list already right Brenda I think you yeah you're on all the lists I want to make sure yeah I think you are no you definitely are I'm terrible with um hey Miranda Castles
